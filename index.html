    <h1>Volūmen</h1>
    <p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I mainly use notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “scroll” referring to a rolled
manuscript. In ancient Rome, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was the
standard format for written texts before the codex, or bound book,
became common.</p>

<p>2025-09-11</p>
<p>I came across this interesting thought on the internet: Consistent
daily writing yields a book in a year, while sporadic efforts result in
scattered fragments. The impact is profound. The initial effort feels
heavy, the first page slow, and the first video awkward, but each effort
lays groundwork for the next, multiplying rather than adding. - JA

<h1 id="seneca-effect">Seneca Effect</h1>
<p>2025-09-07</p>
<p>The Seneca Effect <span class="citation"
data-cites="bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017">(Bardi, 2017)</span>, as explained
by Ugo Bardi, views complex systems through a systems-thinking lens.
Drawing on Seneca’s observation that ”increases are of sluggish growth,
but the way to ruin is rapid,” the book suggests that systems grow
gradually but collapse swiftly due to fragilities, critical thresholds,
and negative feedback loops.</p>
<p>In contrast, Everett Rogers’ ”Diffusion of Innovations” <span
class="citation" data-cites="rogersDiffusionInnovations5th2003">(Rogers,
2003)</span> explains how innovations spread through social systems,
from innovators to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and
laggards. Network effects, where a product’s value increases with its
user base, accelerate adoption.</p>
<p>The Seneca curve, with slow growth and rapid collapse, contrasts with
the viral adoption curve, or ”Hype curve”, which exhibits rapid growth
followed by a slower decline. Rogers’ model, driven by social contagion
and positive feedback, leads to swift adoption, but enthusiasm may wane
as market saturation or limitations emerge.</p>
<p>From a system dynamics perspective, the Seneca Effect is fuelled by
negative feedback loops that amplify vulnerabilities, causing rapid
collapse. Conversely, the Hype curve is propelled by positive feedback
loops, such as network effects and social influence, accelerating
adoption but potentially diminishing over time, leading to a gradual
decline.</p>

<p>I once came across this thought, though I can’t recall where: regrets
belong to the past, and anxieties to the future. One cannot be at peace
with life without truly living it. The past is fixed, the future
uncertain and often overwhelming. The mind wrestles with both, but the
solution is simple: accept imperfection and move forward.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I prefer durable, straightforward hardware. For writing, I use
Leuchtturm1917 and MD notebooks, mechanical pencils, simple fountain
pens, and sticky notes. My daily devices include an iPad Air, a Mac
Studio with a monitor, an iPhone, and two SSDs, supported by older Apple
peripherals. For leisure, I use Apple TV, Sony headphones, and Sonos
speakers. For music, I play older Fender and Gibson guitars, a tube
amplifier, and a digital effects unit.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I like to keep my tools simple. At home, I use macOS’s built-in apps
and Homebrew to manage software. Bash and Python handle automation. For
writing and research, I move through Obsidian, Pandoc, Positron, Quarto,
and Zotero. KeePassXC and NetNewsWire keep things secure and connected,
while Spotify and MuseScore take care of the music. By contrast, work
feels more like a uniform: the standard Microsoft suite, with a little
freedom in Notepad++ for notes and Firefox for the Internet.</p>

<p>I recorded my Week 8 performance, which proceeded smoothly. I have
modified my approach by not recording every exercise, instead focusing
on daily guitar practice and study. On Day 7, following a breathing
session, I played continuously without stopping for mistakes, recording
the full set in a single take. I treated it as a real performance,
beginning with a breath and concluding with a smile. Today, I forgot to
include “Amazing Grace” at the end. There were some mistakes, but they
did not affect me. I particularly appreciated the sound of my
instrument, on which I focused. My emphasis was on tone rather than
speed, except for the last couple of bars of the shuffle in A, where I
played slightly faster than the metronome.</p>

<h1 id="asymmetries">Asymmetries</h1>
<p>2025-08-25</p>
<p>I noticed certain asymmetries that govern the relationship between
positive and negative outcomes—for example effort versus gain;
especially once a critical point has been passed, such as the point of
diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The Pareto distribution provides another example of this kind of
asymmetry (roughly 80% of outcomes stem from 20% of causes).</p>
<p>This phenomenon is also discussed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb,
particularly in relation to “long tails.” He frequently emphasizes
asymmetry and fat-tailed distributions in the context of risk,
probability, and decision-making, especially in his books <em>The Black
Swan</em> and <em>Antifragile</em>. <span class="citation"

and developed a practical system to counteract it. I try to do the same
when reading or listening to podcasts. Here’s an idea that goes against
the grain:</p>
<p>Chinese economist Keyu Jin discusses the Chinese motto “quick, flat,
fast.” While it’s considered a short-term trend, short-termism
prioritizes immediate profit or reward, quick execution of projects, and
short-term results over long-term results and strategic action.</p>

nature, and culture often leaves us in overwhelming awe, yet these
moments tend to slip away with time, leaving only fragments in our
long-term memory. What is almost permanently stored in the mind,
however, are some ordinary parts of experiences and the sensations they
evoked: a quiet street with rundown houses, yet somehow charming, or a
walk on flat terrain by the rice paddies, bringing truly remarkable
emotions despite seemingly unremarkable perceptions for most people. I
find this hard to grasp and somewhat bizarre, but I must accept it.

<li>Reflection strengthens understanding by consolidating knowledge

<li>Intuition, developed through reflection and experience, recognizes

<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>The longer you remain seated and focus on a task, the shallower you
breathe, and the less oxygen gets to your brain. Therefore, quickly step
away from your work and cycle your attention every 20 minutes. Quickly
stepping away from your work to get a drink of water, walk around the
block, or go to the bathroom to splash water on your face allows you to
consciously regulate your breathing and get more oxygen to your brain
(so you can extend your focus session).</p>
<p>During your mini work breaks perform “box breathing” like Navy Seals
do before combat:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a deep four second inhale,</li>
<li>hold for four seconds,</li>
<li>exhale for four seconds,</li>
<li>hold for another four seconds</li>
<li>repeat for the entire work break.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you move during your mini work break, you can replenish the
neurochemicals you need to focus. Dr. Andrew Huberman says, “Physical
movement activates pathways in the brain that increase dopamine, which
is the basis for epinephrine (aka, adrenaline) and all neural energy.”
In other words, a short movement period can provide the fuel to focus
intensely and continue producing at a high level.</p>

<h1 id="truth-lies--deception">Truth, Lies &amp; Deception</h1>
<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>A Turkish proverb says, “A fool may throw a stone into a well that a
hundred wise men cannot pull out.” Inspired by this, one observation is,
“One lie cannot be undone by forty truths.” Both express that a single
careless act can have severe consequences, even with effort and truth.
They highlight the asymmetry between destruction and repair, deception
and truth.</p>
<h2 id="compare-and-contrast">Compare and Contrast</h2>
<p>The first proverb suggests reckless actions can create problems even
the wisest struggle to fix. The metaphor of the stone in the well
emphasizes permanence and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>The second saying shifts the focus to honesty and deception. A single
lie, once spoken, alters perception and trust, making it difficult to
correct with numerous truths. Like the stone in the well, the damage
lingers.</p>
<p>Both reflect human nature: words and actions, especially careless
ones, can have a greater impact than we anticipate. Even wisdom and
truth have limits in undoing past mistakes.</p>
<p>From a philosophical perspective, these expressions address the
irreversibility of certain actions and the asymmetry between harm and
repair. They touch on ethics, epistemology, and human nature.</p>
<p>This aligns with Hannah Arendt’s <span class="citation"
data-cites="tommelHannahArendt2025">(Tömmel &amp; d’Entreves,
2025)</span> concept of irreversibility, where actions have a life of
their own beyond their originator. A fool’s action, like throwing a
stone or telling a lie, sets something in motion that can’t be
undone.</p>
<p>The second expression, “One lie cannot be undone by forty truths,”
highlights the fragility of trust in human relationships. In Kantian
ethics, <span class="citation"
data-cites="johnsonKantsMoralPhilosophy2024">(Johnson &amp; Cureton,
2024)</span> truthfulness is a moral imperative, as deception corrupts
moral interaction. A single lie disrupts reality and makes it difficult
to restore trust with repeated truths.</p>
<p>Nietzsche also explored this idea, arguing that truth is
psychological and social. Once a lie is introduced, it reshapes
perception and makes reality unstable <span class="citation"
data-cites="nietzscheGayScienceSimplified2024">(Nietzsche, 2024)</span>
and <span class="citation"
data-cites="nietzscheTwilightIdolsFriedrich2018">(Nietzsche,
2018)</span>. The struggle to restore trust involves addressing the
distortion, not just offering more truth. <span class="citation"
data-cites="nietzscheGoodEvil2010">(Nietzsche, 2010)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="nietzscheWillPower2017">(Nietzsche,
2017)</span></p>
<p>Both sayings suggest the limits of wisdom. Even the wise are
powerless against certain forms of foolishness. The assumption that
knowledge and truth can always correct falsehoods is an illusion. Wisdom
can only mitigate consequences, not erase them. True wisdom may lie in
recognizing that some things, once done, can’t be undone.</p>
<p>Ultimately, responsibility lies in preventing harm before it occurs.
Once the stone is in the well or the lie is spoken, the damage is done.
This aligns with Buddhist and Stoic philosophies, which emphasize
mindfulness in action and speech, understanding that careless or
dishonest actions can create suffering beyond our control.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A single lie lingers, no matter how many truths try to wash it
away.</p>

<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>Concision is to mind what cleanliness is to the body. Concision, like
cleanliness, plays a crucial role in personal and professional life.
Just as cleanliness eliminates dirt and clutter from the body, concision
eliminates unnecessary words and ideas from communication, leaving
behind clear, precise, and effective messages.</p>
<p>A concise mind expresses ideas efficiently, avoiding redundancy or
overcomplication—just as a clean body is free from excess grime. In both
cases, the result is clarity, ease, and refinement.</p>

<h1 id="truth-vs-bs">Truth vs BS</h1>
<p>2025-05-26</p>
<p>Considering current times, the number of books and mass media, the
situation is a lot worse today. Also, no country has fallen as Roman
Empire did… So it’s a lot worse but global dynamics also evolved.
Untruth existed for a long time and there’s nothing new about mind
boggling nonsense that affected (negatively) the history of mankind.

<h1 id="negative-utility">Negative Utility</h1>
<p>2025-04-22</p>
<p>To begin, you require only a book, a pen, and time. While additional
tools may appear beneficial, they can be counterproductive, resulting in
negative utility. These tools do not accelerate your work; rather, they
consume as much time as you are willing to expend on them.</p>
<p>The essence of productivity lies in performing the work itself. This
is the only productivity advice you need and the most valuable guidance
you will receive.</p>
<p>You could divert your attention to numerous optimizations, such as
managing email, scheduling meetings, organizing notes, maintaining
calendars, tracking time, setting goals, creating to-do lists,
estimating time requirements, applying prioritization frameworks, using
quantified self-sensors, analyzing data, adopting apps, managing
documents, or journaling.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to resist the temptation to become mired in
these optimizations. Instead, prioritize executing the work. When you
focus on the work, all other aspects will naturally optimize
themselves.</p>

<p>The objective is to make everything as simple as possible, but not
simpler.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Self-imposed constraints facilitate
the simplification of concepts and processes. However, the risk of
oversimplification must be considered, as it may compromise the desired
outcome. Thus, self-imposed constraints can be regarded as an art form,
enabling the effective achievement of goals.</p>
<p>When a task involves numerous steps or requires substantial
resources, its completion becomes increasingly challenging. Self-imposed
constraints help minimize or eliminate distractions and foster
creativity. Creativity, in turn, is the key to originality.</p>

<p>2025-03-27</p>
<p>When man is spared real struggle, he manufactures his own. Deprived
of battle, he wages war against shadows, offended by whispers, unsettled
by silence. The absence of hardship does not bring peace; it breeds
restlessness.</p>
<p>Work suffers the same fate. Without a higher purpose, we busy
ourselves with the trivial, polishing stones that need no shine. We
mistake movement for progress, refinement for creation.</p>
<p>Man was not made for stillness. Even in calm waters, his spirit
thrashes, yearning for a storm.</p>

<p>2025-02-17</p>
<p>Willpower, like a muscle, can tire. The only question is when.</p>
<p>Rules, like guidelines, help us navigate life. We’ve been taught to
follow them since childhood. Think about speed limits, hallway running,
and instructions. Rules are everywhere, but we haven’t used them to our
advantage. They shape our behaviour and can help us achieve our
goals.</p>
<p>Make good choices the default choice.</p>
<p>When you use willpower to make your future self’s choices, create an
automatic rule.</p>

<h1 id="on-truthfulness">On Truthfulness</h1>
<p>2025-02-02</p>
<p>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool,
for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.</p>
<p>This rule presents a nuanced view of truthfulness, balancing moral
integrity with practical wisdom.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. This emphasizes integrity and consistency. Actions should
reflect truth, even when it is difficult or disadvantageous. Honesty in
behavior builds trust and self-respect.</li>
<li>Never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is
capable of distorting and destroying the truth. Here, “fool” likely
refers to someone who lacks wisdom, is incapable of understanding truth,
or deliberately twists it. In such cases, speaking the truth can be
harmful rather than enlightening. A fool may manipulate truth to serve
their own misunderstanding or deception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Underlying Principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth should be upheld in one’s own actions and character.</li>
<li>However, truth should be wisely shared, considering the capacity of
the listener to understand and respect it.</li>
<li>Sometimes, silence or discretion is more powerful than speaking the
truth to those who will misuse it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This aligns with ancient wisdom, like in Proverbs:</p>
<p>“Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be
just like him.” (Proverbs 26:4)</p>

<h1 id="rules-of-the-game">Rules of the Game</h1>
<p>2023-10-31</p>
<p>It is more feasible to play and potentially win a game of chess when
competing against an opponent who is also adhering to the rules of
chess. It is inconceivable to assume otherwise, as an opponent playing a
different game would fundamentally undermine the contest. Nevertheless,
it is entirely possible for individuals to engage in games without
adhering to established rules. A prudent individual must pause and
consider whether both parties are indeed playing the same game.</p>
<p>People frequently disregard or bend rules and conventions. Therefore,
one should never assume that an opponent is fully aware of the rules or
will adhere to the intended structure of the game.</p>
<p>Competent chess players often find it challenging to compete against
complete novices, as they are frequently surprised by the unconventional
moves novices make.</p>
<p>This principle extends beyond chess to any rule-based interaction,
where mutual understanding of conventions is critical.</p>

<h1 id="on-rigidity">On Rigidity</h1>
<p>2023-10-20</p>
<p>Rigid things have a tendency to break. For example, physical things
like airplane wings or ships will flex and not break when in turbulence.
Non-physical things such as rules, procedures, and protocols, unless
flexible, will break when under pressure.</p>
<p>Flexible things have a tendency to adapt. Thus, it’s important to
find a balance between rigidity and flexibility. Strong enough to
withstand and weak enough to conform and all the while maintain physical
and non-physical integrity.</p>
<p>Perfectionism and idealism bring about rigidity; keep that in mind,
always. The problem is that you are a perfectionist. The desire for
perfection could be a deadly weakness; see <span class="citation"

Interoperability stems from clear, unembellished content.</li>

<h1 id="attention-manipulated">Attention Manipulated</h1>
<p>2023-07-21</p>
<p>I recall Nassim Taleb’s advice to avoid reading newspapers. If one
must engage with them, he suggests reading editions from a year prior,
allowing you to assess the news with the benefit of hindsight and a
clearer perspective.</p>
<p>News can shape our perceptions in distinct ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive news: Uplifting stories, affirmations, and
encouragement.</li>
<li>Negative news: Drama, criticism, and controversy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our workplaces, communities, or neighborhoods, whether a high-rise
building, a city block, or a small town, news circulates constantly,
influencing our decisions. To maintain clarity, we must discern what is
truly valuable from what is mere noise. Often, this means turning off
the news or avoiding newspapers altogether.</p>

<h1 id="effort-vs-results">Effort vs Results</h1>

other parts don’t match—like bad eating or poor balance. Success grows
slowly but can be lost quickly. Don’t undo what you’re working for.</p>
