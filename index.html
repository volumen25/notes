    <h1>Volūmen</h1>
    <p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I mainly use notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “scroll” referring to a rolled
manuscript. In ancient Rome, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was the
standard format for written texts before the codex, or bound book,
became common.</p>

<h1 id="seneca-effect">Seneca Effect</h1>
<p>2025-09-07 01:13:00</p>
<p>The Seneca Effect <span class="citation"
data-cites="bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017">(Bardi, 2017)</span>, as explained
by Ugo Bardi, views complex systems through a systems-thinking lens.
Drawing on Seneca’s observation that ”increases are of sluggish growth,
but the way to ruin is rapid,” the book suggests that systems grow
gradually but collapse swiftly due to fragilities, critical thresholds,
and negative feedback loops.</p>
<p>In contrast, Everett Rogers’ ”Diffusion of Innovations” <span
class="citation" data-cites="rogersDiffusionInnovations5th2003">(Rogers,
2003)</span> explains how innovations spread through social systems,
from innovators to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and
laggards. Network effects, where a product’s value increases with its
user base, accelerate adoption.</p>
<p>The Seneca curve, with slow growth and rapid collapse, contrasts with
the viral adoption curve, or ”Hype curve”, which exhibits rapid growth
followed by a slower decline. Rogers’ model, driven by social contagion
and positive feedback, leads to swift adoption, but enthusiasm may wane
as market saturation or limitations emerge.</p>
<p>From a system dynamics perspective, the Seneca Effect is fuelled by
negative feedback loops that amplify vulnerabilities, causing rapid
collapse. Conversely, the Hype curve is propelled by positive feedback
loops, such as network effects and social influence, accelerating
adoption but potentially diminishing over time, leading to a gradual
decline.</p>

<h1 id="imperfection">Imperfection</h1>
<p>2025-09-06</p>
<p>I once came across this thought, though I can’t recall where: regrets
belong to the past, and anxieties to the future. One cannot be at peace
with life without truly living it. The past is fixed, the future
uncertain and often overwhelming. The mind wrestles with both, but the
solution is simple: accept imperfection and move on.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I prefer durable, straightforward hardware. For writing, I use
Leuchtturm1917 and MD notebooks, mechanical pencils, simple fountain
pens, and sticky notes. My daily devices include an iPad Air, a Mac
Studio with a monitor, an iPhone, and two SSDs, supported by older Apple
peripherals. For leisure, I use Apple TV, Sony headphones, and Sonos
speakers. For music, I play older Fender and Gibson guitars, a tube
amplifier, and a digital effects unit.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I like to keep my tools simple. At home, I use macOS’s built-in apps
and Homebrew to manage software. Bash and Python handle automation. For
writing and research, I move through Obsidian, Pandoc, Positron, Quarto,
and Zotero. KeePassXC and NetNewsWire keep things secure and connected,
while Spotify and MuseScore take care of the music. By contrast, work
feels more like a uniform: the standard Microsoft suite, with a little
freedom in Notepad++ for notes and Firefox for the Internet.</p>

<p>I recorded my Week 8 performance, which proceeded smoothly. I have
modified my approach by not recording every exercise, instead focusing
on daily guitar practice and study. On Day 7, following a breathing
session, I played continuously without stopping for mistakes, recording
the full set in a single take. I treated it as a real performance,
beginning with a breath and concluding with a smile. Today, I forgot to
include “Amazing Grace” at the end. There were some mistakes, but they
did not affect me. I particularly appreciated the sound of my
instrument, on which I focused. My emphasis was on tone rather than
speed, except for the last couple of bars of the shuffle in A, where I
played slightly faster than the metronome.</p>

<p>I find myself increasingly drawn to a “one-and-done” philosophy when

don’t have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the

understand something deeply, to let it reveal its full functionality
over time, one must live with it for years. Multiplicity divides

<h1 id="asymmetries">Asymmetries</h1>
<p>2025-08-25</p>
<p>I noticed certain asymmetries that govern the relationship between
positive and negative outcomes—for example effort versus gain;
especially once a critical point has been passed, such as the point of
diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The Pareto distribution provides another example of this kind of
asymmetry (roughly 80% of outcomes stem from 20% of causes).</p>
<p>This phenomenon is also discussed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb,
particularly in relation to “long tails.” He frequently emphasizes
asymmetry and fat-tailed distributions in the context of risk,
probability, and decision-making, especially in his books <em>The Black
Swan</em> and <em>Antifragile</em>. <span class="citation"

and developed a practical system to counteract it. I try to do the same
when reading or listening to podcasts. Here’s an idea that goes against
the grain:</p>
<p>Chinese economist Keyu Jin discusses the Chinese motto “quick, flat,
fast.” While it’s considered a short-term trend, short-termism
prioritizes immediate profit or reward, quick execution of projects, and
short-term results over long-term results and strategic action.</p>

nature, and culture often leaves us in overwhelming awe, yet these
moments tend to slip away with time, leaving only fragments in our
long-term memory. What is almost permanently stored in the mind,
however, are some ordinary parts of experiences and the sensations they
evoked: a quiet street with rundown houses, yet somehow charming, or a
walk on flat terrain by the rice paddies, bringing truly remarkable
emotions despite seemingly unremarkable perceptions for most people. I
find this hard to grasp and somewhat bizarre, but I must accept it.

<p>This principle aligns with learning theory, cognitive science, and
decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection strengthens understanding by consolidating knowledge
through critical thinking.</li>
<li>Intuition, developed through reflection and experience, recognizes
patterns based on past experiences, as seen in expertise
development.</li>
<li>Reflection enables effective decision-making under uncertainty, as
seen in fields like medicine, engineering, and chess, where seasoned
practitioners rely on intuition.</li>

<h1 id="experiments-vs-exercises">Experiments vs. Exercises</h1>
<p>2025-08-08</p>
<p>Thought experiments are mental exercises that explore scenarios and
analyze concepts without physical action. They are commonly used in
philosophy, science, and ethics to challenge assumptions and clarify
ideas. For example, Maxwell’s Demon: A hypothetical demon that seemingly
violates thermodynamic laws. The thought experiments enhance imagination
and logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Thought exercises, akin to thought experiments, focus on brain
training to enhance problem-solving and creativity. For example “What
Would X Do?”: Considering how a famous thinker would approach a problem.
These exercises foster broader thinking and creativity.</p>
<p>The key difference is that thought experiments often involve
hypothetical scenarios with specific parameters, while thought exercises
are more open-ended and encourage creative thinking. Both thought
experiments and thought exercises are valuable tools for intellectual
exploration.</p>

<h1 id="80-percent-limit">80 Percent Limit</h1>
<p>2025-08-08</p>
<p>Learn to stop at 80% mark in eating, talking, and working to stay
sharp, leave space for others, and keep your energy for what matters.
The idea of stopping at 80% comes from the Japanese concept hara hachi
bu, which means eating until you’re about 80% full. This idea can also
be applied to other areas of life, like conversations and work, to help
improve communication and productivity.</p>
<p>In conversations: Refrain from over-explaining or dominating the
conversation. This creates space for others to share and encourages
active listening, leading to more meaningful exchanges. For example, in
a meeting, share your thoughts clearly but leave room for others to add
their ideas. Even if you’re passionate about the topic, resist the urge
to ramble.</p>
<p>In work: Know when you’ve hit the point of diminishing returns, when
extra effort won’t produce much more progress. Stopping before burnout
helps you recharge and stay productive. For instance, if you’ve made
good progress on a report but feel mentally drained, take a break
instead of forcing yourself to finish. You’ll return with fresh energy
and clearer thinking.</p>

<h1 id="premature-optimization">Premature Optimization</h1>
<p>2025-08-03</p>
<p>As Donald Knuth wrote in 1974, programmers often waste effort
optimizing too early; “premature optimization is the root of all evil
(or at least most of it) in programming” <span class="citation"
data-cites="knuthStructuredProgrammingGo1974">(Knuth, 1974)</span>. This
sentiment applies beyond code. We often fall into the trap of
optimization too early, whether in programming, designing a template, or
starting an exercise routine. Instead of putting a functional version to
use, we start tweaking it, reshaping it until we barely recognize it. As
a result, we lose the value of the original. The code ends up doing
things we do not need, the template produces excessive output, and the
workout becomes so complicated that it discourages us from following
through.</p>
<p>It is often better to stick with the raw idea, no matter how rough or
unrefined it may be. If you follow it long enough, perhaps for a year or
even a month, you may start to notice natural patterns emerge. Haruki
Murakami describes a similar experience in <em>Novelist as a
Vocation</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="murakamiNovelistVocation2022">(Murakami, 2022)</span>. Early
in his career, feeling constrained by traditional Japanese prose, he
began writing in English and then translating the text back into
Japanese. The process was not optimal, but it helped him discover a
personal voice. Rather than optimizing the method, he committed to it,
letting clarity and style emerge over time through repeated
practice.</p>

<h1 id="sustain-or-cycle">Sustain or cycle</h1>
<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>The longer you remain seated and focus on a task, the shallower you
breathe, and the less oxygen gets to your brain. Therefore, quickly step
away from your work and cycle your attention every 20 minutes. Quickly
stepping away from your work to get a drink of water, walk around the
block, or go to the bathroom to splash water on your face allows you to
consciously regulate your breathing and get more oxygen to your brain
(so you can extend your focus session).</p>
<p>During your mini work breaks perform “box breathing” like Navy Seals
do before combat:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a deep four second inhale,</li>
<li>hold for four seconds,</li>
<li>exhale for four seconds,</li>
<li>hold for another four seconds</li>
<li>repeat for the entire work break.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you move during your mini work break, you can replenish the
neurochemicals you need to focus. Dr. Andrew Huberman says, “Physical
movement activates pathways in the brain that increase dopamine, which
is the basis for epinephrine (aka, adrenaline) and all neural energy.”
In other words, a short movement period can provide the fuel to focus
intensely and continue producing at a high level.</p>

<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>Some problems come from life itself—they shape us, test us, make us
stronger. Struggling with them gives the soul weight and meaning. But
other problems are man-made—born of fear, control, and small minds. They
do not lift us up; they drain us. In places ruled by politics and
pretense, effort leads nowhere. Spirit fades. It is better to face real
storms than to rot in still air. Better a hard truth than a quiet,

<h1 id="truth-lies--deception">Truth, Lies &amp; Deception</h1>
<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>A Turkish proverb says, “A fool may throw a stone into a well that a
hundred wise men cannot pull out.” Inspired by this, one observation is,
“One lie cannot be undone by forty truths.” Both express that a single
careless act can have severe consequences, even with effort and truth.
They highlight the asymmetry between destruction and repair, deception
and truth.</p>
<h2 id="compare-and-contrast">Compare and Contrast</h2>
<p>The first proverb suggests reckless actions can create problems even
the wisest struggle to fix. The metaphor of the stone in the well
emphasizes permanence and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>The second saying shifts the focus to honesty and deception. A single
lie, once spoken, alters perception and trust, making it difficult to
correct with numerous truths. Like the stone in the well, the damage
lingers.</p>
<p>Both reflect human nature: words and actions, especially careless
ones, can have a greater impact than we anticipate. Even wisdom and
truth have limits in undoing past mistakes.</p>
<p>The wise are powerless against certain forms of foolishness. The
assumption that knowledge and truth can always correct falsehoods is an
illusion. Wisdom can only mitigate consequences, not erase them. True
wisdom may lie in recognizing that some things, once done, can’t be
undone. Ultimately, responsibility lies in preventing harm before it
occurs. Once the stone is in the well or the lie is spoken, the damage
is done.</p>

<p>A single lie lingers, no matter how many truths try to wash it away.

<h1 id="negative-utility">Negative Utility</h1>
<p>2025-04-22</p>
<p>To begin, you require only a book, a pen, and time. While additional
tools may appear beneficial, they can be counterproductive, resulting in
negative utility. These tools do not accelerate your work; rather, they
consume as much time as you are willing to expend on them. The essence
of productivity lies in performing the work itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work expands to fill the time available for its completion
(Parkinson’s law)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could divert your attention to numerous optimizations, such as
managing email, scheduling meetings, organizing notes, maintaining
calendars, tracking time, setting goals, creating to-do lists,
estimating time requirements, applying prioritization frameworks, using
quantified self-sensors, analyzing data, adopting apps, managing
documents, or journaling.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to resist the temptation to become mired in
these optimizations. Instead, prioritize executing the work. When you
focus on the work, all other aspects will naturally optimize
themselves.</p>

However, the risk of oversimplification must be considered, as it may

regarded as an art form, enabling the effective achievement of
goals.</p>
<p>When a task involves numerous steps or requires substantial

<p>2025-02-02</p>
<p>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool,
for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.</p>
<p>This rule presents a nuanced view of truthfulness, balancing moral
integrity with practical wisdom.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. This emphasizes integrity and consistency. Actions should
reflect truth, even when it is difficult or disadvantageous. Honesty in
behavior builds trust and self-respect.</li>
<li>Never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is
capable of distorting and destroying the truth. Here, “fool” likely
refers to someone who lacks wisdom, is incapable of understanding truth,
or deliberately twists it. In such cases, speaking the truth can be
harmful rather than enlightening. A fool may manipulate truth to serve
their own misunderstanding or deception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Underlying Principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth should be upheld in one’s own actions and character.</li>
<li>However, truth should be wisely shared, considering the capacity of
the listener to understand and respect it.</li>
<li>Sometimes, silence or discretion is more powerful than speaking the
truth to those who will misuse it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This aligns with ancient wisdom, like in Proverbs:</p>
<p>“Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be
just like him.” (Proverbs 26:4)</p>

little. When you get in a fog, it’s very difficult to dry yourself.
Practicing slowly is the same; true progress is the result of slow
practice, little by little.</p>
<p>When you keep this simple practice, you will obtain some wonderful
powers. Before you attain it, it’s something wonderful, but after you
attain it, it’s nothing special.</p>
<p>Stop and think: what is wonderful is the act of practice itself. Now
you can restart and keep practicing.</p>
<p>When there’s no gaining idea in what you do, then you do

<p>Forget all gaining ideas, all dualistic ideas. Just practice zazen in

<h1 id="rules-of-the-game">Rules of the Game</h1>
<p>2023-10-31</p>
<p>It is more feasible to play and potentially win a game of chess when
competing against an opponent who is also adhering to the rules of
chess. It is inconceivable to assume otherwise, as an opponent playing a
different game would fundamentally undermine the contest. Nevertheless,
it is entirely possible for individuals to engage in games without
adhering to established rules. A prudent individual must pause and
consider whether both parties are indeed playing the same game.</p>
<p>People frequently disregard or bend rules and conventions. Therefore,
one should never assume that an opponent is fully aware of the rules or
will adhere to the intended structure of the game.</p>
<p>Competent chess players often find it challenging to compete against
complete novices, as they are frequently surprised by the unconventional
moves novices make.</p>
<p>This principle extends beyond chess to any rule-based interaction,
where mutual understanding of conventions is critical.</p>

<p>Many jobs are pointless or most jobs have elements of pointless
activities. Pay attention to the people and the positions they hold. If
you identify any of the five types, do not waste your precious time.
Most importantly if you discover your job is nothing but bs, you must
find ways to deal with its latent consequences. Many people suffered
from bs jobs and others occupied themselves with learning other skills
(e.g. languages, programming, etc.) while holding bs jobs.</p>
<p>David Graeber lists five different categories of job types <span

<ol type="1">
<li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important,
e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store
greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed
for looks;</li>
<li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their
employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public
relations specialists, community managers;</li>
<li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed
permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk
staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;</li>
<li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is
being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house
magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, quality
service managers;</li>
<li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it,
e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes
need not, or should not, exist. That if the job, or even the whole
industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone,
or the world might even be a slightly better place. - David Graeber</p>

<p>News can shape our perceptions in distinct ways:</p>
<ul>

encouragement.</li>
<li>Negative news: Drama, criticism, and controversy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our workplaces, communities, or neighborhoods, whether a high-rise
building, a city block, or a small town, news circulates constantly,

<h2 id="a-ten-step-approach">A Ten-Step Approach</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stretch</li>
<li>Settle down in your environment: Be present, correct posture,
breathing.</li>
<li>Tune into your heart: Recalling profound feelings is how to tune
into your heart.</li>
<li>Use your body in a comfortable and natural way. Mechanics, habits
and emotions…</li>
<li>Follow your curiosity as you practice.</li>
<li>Recognize three styles of struggle:
<ol type="1">
<li>Overstated passion, in which we cling to the music.</li>
<li>Avoidance, in which we resist dealing with the music.</li>
<li>Aggression, in which we attack the music.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Drop your attitudes and be simple.</li>
<li>Apply three listening techniques:
<ol type="1">
<li>Sing the notes and lines.</li>
<li>Place your attention on the vibrations.</li>
<li>Place your attention on each sound as it resonates in the space
around you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Organize notes into groups, phrases, and textures.</li>
<li>Place your attention on the sensations of touch and movement.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relax, tension is your worst enemy</li>
<li>Hear the music you’re playing</li>
<li>Be gentle to yourself</li>
<li>Do not over practice, short mindful work is superior to long
laboured practice sessions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-notes">Miscellaneous Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swing the music instead of sounding like sewing machine. Group notes
and play them by creating a forward motion.</li>
<li>Focus on more on the sensations of touch and movement and use your
vision mainly to check that what you feel is in accord with what you
see. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bruserArtPracticingGuide1999">Bruser &amp; Menuhin (1999, p.

<li>Think the sound you make. Then discover the sensation your brain has
created for you. <span class="citation"
