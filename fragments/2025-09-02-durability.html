<h1 id="durability">Durability</h1>
<p>2025-09-02</p>
<p>When it comes to tools, I prefer those that strike a balance between
durability and simplicity. Durable tools endure wear and tear, ensuring
their longevity and maximizing the value of investment. Simplicity in
design and usage makes tasks easier and more efficient. I value tools
that are both durable and user-friendly.</p>
