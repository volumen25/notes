<p>2025-05-26</p>
<p>Considering current times, the number of books and mass media, the
situation is a lot worse today. Also, no country has fallen as Roman
Empire did… So it’s a lot worse but global dynamics also evolved.
Untruth existed for a long time and there’s nothing new about mind
boggling nonsense that affected (negatively) the history of mankind.
