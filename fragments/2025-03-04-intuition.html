Intuition</h1>

<p>Reflect on what youÂ’ve read and written. Information becomes knowledge
by reflection. Reflection cultivates intuition. Abundant intuition makes
up for the lack of information, thereby enabling you to operate where
your knowledge is limited.</p>
<p>This principle aligns with learning theory, cognitive science, and
decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection strengthens understanding by consolidating knowledge
through critical thinking.</li>
<li>Intuition, developed through reflection and experience, recognizes
patterns based on past experiences, as seen in expertise
development.</li>
<li>Reflection enables effective decision-making under uncertainty, as
seen in fields like medicine, engineering, and chess, where seasoned
practitioners rely on intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, reflection turns raw data into actionable knowledge, making
this principle sound and useful.</p>
