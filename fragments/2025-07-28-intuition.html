<p>Daniel Kahneman said most people make quick judgments and then try to
prove themselves right. The wisest wait, gather facts, and trust their
intuition last.</p>
<p>I recently learned that Kahneman passed away on March 27, 2024,
though his death wasn’t announced until March 2025. He was best known
for his work on System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is fast and
automatic but prone to errors. System 2 is slower and more deliberate,
used for careful thinking and problem-solving.</p>
