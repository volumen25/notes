<li>The mind, like nature, abhors a vacuum. Deprived of real suffering,
it fabricates troubles of its own, magnifying the trivial until it
becomes unbearable.</li>
<li>The absence of hardship does not bring peace; it breeds
restlessness.</li>
<li>The most essential ingredient in any recipe is the appetite of those
to whom the meal is served.</li>
<li>The universe operates on principles that prevent total destruction,
but these same principles also limit easy solutions to life’s
problems.</li>
<li>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool,
for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.</li>
