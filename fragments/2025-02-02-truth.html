<h1 id="on-truthfulness">On Truthfulness</h1>
<p>2025-02-02</p>
<p>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool,
for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.</p>
<p>This rule presents a nuanced view of truthfulness, balancing moral
integrity with practical wisdom.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. This emphasizes integrity and consistency. Actions should
reflect truth, even when it is difficult or disadvantageous. Honesty in
behavior builds trust and self-respect.</li>
<li>Never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is
capable of distorting and destroying the truth. Here, “fool” likely
refers to someone who lacks wisdom, is incapable of understanding truth,
or deliberately twists it. In such cases, speaking the truth can be
harmful rather than enlightening. A fool may manipulate truth to serve
their own misunderstanding or deception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Underlying Principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth should be upheld in one’s own actions and character.</li>
<li>However, truth should be wisely shared, considering the capacity of
the listener to understand and respect it.</li>
<li>Sometimes, silence or discretion is more powerful than speaking the
truth to those who will misuse it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This aligns with ancient wisdom, like in Proverbs:</p>
<p>“Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be
just like him.” (Proverbs 26:4)</p>
