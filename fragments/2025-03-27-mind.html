<p>2025-03-27</p>
<p>When man is spared real struggle, he manufactures his own. Deprived
of battle, he wages war against shadows, offended by whispers, unsettled
by silence. The absence of hardship does not bring peace; it breeds
restlessness.</p>
<p>Work suffers the same fate. Without a higher purpose, we busy
ourselves with the trivial, polishing stones that need no shine. We
mistake movement for progress, refinement for creation.</p>
<p>Man was not made for stillness. Even in calm waters, his spirit
thrashes, yearning for a storm.</p>
