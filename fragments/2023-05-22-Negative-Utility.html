<h1 id="negative-utility">Negative Utility</h1>
<p>2025-04-22</p>
<p>To begin, you require only a book, a pen, and time. While additional
tools may appear beneficial, they can be counterproductive, resulting in
negative utility. These tools do not accelerate your work; rather, they
consume as much time as you are willing to expend on them.</p>
<p>The essence of productivity lies in performing the work itself. This
is the only productivity advice you need and the most valuable guidance
you will receive.</p>
<p>You could divert your attention to numerous optimizations, such as
managing email, scheduling meetings, organizing notes, maintaining
calendars, tracking time, setting goals, creating to-do lists,
estimating time requirements, applying prioritization frameworks, using
quantified self-sensors, analyzing data, adopting apps, managing
documents, or journaling.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to resist the temptation to become mired in
these optimizations. Instead, prioritize executing the work. When you
focus on the work, all other aspects will naturally optimize
themselves.</p>
