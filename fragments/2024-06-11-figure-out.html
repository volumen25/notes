<p>An advise from Richard Feynman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out
what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly
everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work
as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the
best. Don’t think about what you want to be, but what you want to
do.</p>
