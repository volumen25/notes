<p>I came across this interesting thought on the internet: Consistent
daily writing yields a book in a year, while sporadic efforts result in
scattered fragments. The impact is profound. The initial effort feels
heavy, the first page slow, and the first video awkward, but each effort
lays groundwork for the next, multiplying rather than adding. - JA
