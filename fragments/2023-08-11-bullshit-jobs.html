<p>Many jobs are pointless or most jobs have elements of pointless
activities. Pay attention to the people and the positions they hold. If
you identify any of the five types, do not waste your precious time.
Most importantly if you discover your job is nothing but bs, you must
find ways to deal with its latent consequences. Many people suffered
from bs jobs and others occupied themselves with learning other skills
(e.g. languages, programming, etc.) while holding bs jobs.</p>
<p>David Graeber lists five different categories of job types <span
class="citation" data-cites="graeberBullshitJobsTheory2018">Graeber
(2018)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important,
e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store
greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed
for looks;</li>
<li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their
employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public
relations specialists, community managers;</li>
<li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed
permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk
staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;</li>
<li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is
being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house
magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, quality
service managers;</li>
<li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it,
e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes
need not, or should not, exist. That if the job, or even the whole
industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone,
or the world might even be a slightly better place. - David Graeber</p>
