<h1 id="white-christmas">White Christmas</h1>
<p>2025-12-21</p>
<p>I started learning this song in December 2022, approaching it one
phrase at a time and at a very gradual pace in the weeks leading up to
Christmas. In retrospect, I might have chosen a particularly challenging
arrangement, but after dedicating so much time and effort to it, I feel
compelled to continue. The sunk cost fallacy has locked me into seeing
it through to the end.</p>
