<h1 id="one-and-done">One and Done</h1>
<p>2025-08-25</p>
<p>I find myself increasingly drawn to a Â“one-and-doneÂ” philosophy when it
comes to worldly possessions. ThereÂ’s a quiet realization that I donÂ’t
have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the things I
have, like pens, guitars, and other tools. It seems that to understand
something deeply, to let it reveal its full functionality over time, one
must live with it for years. Multiplicity divides attention; depth asks
for commitment.</p>
