<p>The Seneca Effect <span class="citation"
data-cites="bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017">(Bardi, 2017)</span>, as explained
by Ugo Bardi, views complex systems through a systems-thinking lens.
Drawing on Seneca’s observation that ”increases are of sluggish growth,
but the way to ruin is rapid,” the book suggests that systems grow
gradually but collapse swiftly due to fragilities, critical thresholds,
and negative feedback loops.</p>
<p>In contrast, Everett Rogers’ ”Diffusion of Innovations” <span
class="citation" data-cites="rogersDiffusionInnovations5th2003">(Rogers,
2003)</span> explains how innovations spread through social systems,
from innovators to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and
laggards. Network effects, where a product’s value increases with its
user base, accelerate adoption.</p>
<p>The Seneca curve, with slow growth and rapid collapse, contrasts with
the viral adoption curve, or ”Hype curve”, which exhibits rapid growth
followed by a slower decline. Rogers’ model, driven by social contagion
and positive feedback, leads to swift adoption, but enthusiasm may wane
as market saturation or limitations emerge.</p>
<p>From a system dynamics perspective, the Seneca Effect is fuelled by
negative feedback loops that amplify vulnerabilities, causing rapid
collapse. Conversely, the Hype curve is propelled by positive feedback
loops, such as network effects and social influence, accelerating
adoption but potentially diminishing over time, leading to a gradual
decline.</p>
