<p>2025-10-21</p>
<p>From Haruki Murakami’s novel Kafka on the Shore, <span
class="citation" data-cites="murakamiKafkaShore2006">(Murakami,
2006)</span> translated into English by Philip Gabriel. The passage
appears in a section where the character Oshima is speaking to Kafka
Tamura about talent, discipline, and what Murakami calls “the plateau of
talent.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They can’t take it any further. And why not? Because they won’t put
in the effort. Because they haven’t had the discipline pounded into
them. They’ve been spoiled. They have just enough talent so they’ve been
able to play things well without any effort and they’ve had people
telling them how great they are from the time they’re little, so hard
work looks stupid to them. They’ll take some piece another kid has to
work on for three weeks and polish it off in half the time, so the
teacher figures they’ve put enough into it and lets them go to the next
thing. And they do that in half the time and go on to the next piece.
They never find out what it means to be hammered by the teacher; they
lose out on a certain element required for character building. It’s a
tragedy.</p>
