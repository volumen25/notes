Concision is to mind what cleanliness is to the body. Concision, like cleanliness, plays a crucial role in personal and professional life. Just as cleanliness eliminates dirt and clutter from the body, concision eliminates unnecessary words and ideas from communication, leaving behind clear, precise, and effective messages.

A concise mind expresses ideas efficiently, avoiding redundancy or overcomplication—just as a clean body is free from excess grime. In both cases, the result is clarity, ease, and refinement.
