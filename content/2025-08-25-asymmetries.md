I noticed certain asymmetries that govern the relationship between positive and negative outcomesâ€”for example effort versus gain; especially once a critical point has been passed, such as the point of diminishing returns.

The Pareto distribution provides another example of this kind of asymmetry (roughly 80% of outcomes stem from 20% of causes).

This phenomenon is also discussed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, particularly in relation to "long tails." He frequently emphasizes asymmetry and fat-tailed distributions in the context of risk, probability, and decision-making, especially in his books *The Black Swan* and *Antifragile*. @talebBlackSwanSecond2010 and @talebAntifragileThingsThat2012
