description: One can’t be at peace with life if not living it.
---

I once came across this thought, though I can’t recall where: regrets belong to the past, and anxieties to the future. One cannot be at peace with life without truly living it. The past is fixed, the future uncertain and often overwhelming. The mind wrestles with both, but the solution is simple: accept imperfection and move on.
