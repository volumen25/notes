description: A few things worth noting.

I find myself increasingly drawn to a “one-and-done” philosophy when it comes to worldly possessions. There’s a quiet realization that I don’t have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the things I have, like pens, guitars, and other tools. It seems that to understand something deeply, to let it reveal its full functionality over time, one must live with it for years. Multiplicity divides attention; depth asks for commitment.
