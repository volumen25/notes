It is more feasible to play and potentially win a game of chess when competing against an opponent who is also adhering to the rules of chess. It is inconceivable to assume otherwise, as an opponent playing a different game would fundamentally undermine the contest. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible for individuals to engage in games without adhering to established rules. A prudent individual must pause and consider whether both parties are indeed playing the same game.

People frequently disregard or bend rules and conventions. Therefore, one should never assume that an opponent is fully aware of the rules or will adhere to the intended structure of the game.

Competent chess players often find it challenging to compete against complete novices, as they are frequently surprised by the unconventional moves novices make.

This principle extends beyond chess to any rule-based interaction, where mutual understanding of conventions is critical.
