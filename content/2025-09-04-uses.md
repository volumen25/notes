description: A few things worth noting.
---

When I need guidance or ways to solve problems, I turn to trusted sources. For classical philosophy and strategy, I rely on works about leadership and discipline [@musashiBookFiveRings2005; @tzuArtWar2005], ethical governance [@tzuTaoTeChing1989; @machiavelliPrince1998], and Stoic reflections on life and virtue [@senecaShortnessLifeOther1997; @aureliusMeditationsNewTranslation2003]. For modern thought and science, I draw on ideas about mindfulness [@suzukiZenMindBeginner2020], philosophy [@wattsMyOwnWay2007; @frankfurtBullshit2005], scientific discovery [@rovelliThereArePlaces2022; @penroseRoadRealityComplete2004], probability and risk [@talebFooledRandomnessHidden2005], and problem-solving [@polyaHowSolveIt2014]. I also enjoy literature that explores human behaviour and history [@murakamiNovelistVocation2022; @greeneLawsHumanNature2019; @rutherfurdNewYorkNovel2010].

## Software

I try to keep my tools simple and reliable. On my Mac, I mainly use built-in applications and Homebrew, a tool for installing and managing software. Bash and Python help with scripting and automation; Obsidian, Pandoc, Quarto, Positron, and Zotero support writing and research; KeePassXC and NetNewsWire help manage security and stay updated on news; and Spotify and MuseScore are for music. At work, I use Notepad++ and Firefox.

## Hardware

I prefer durable, straightforward hardware. For writing, I use Leuchtturm1917 and MD notebooks, mechanical pencils, simple fountain pens, and sticky notes. My daily devices include an iPad Air, a Mac Studio with a monitor, an iPhone, and two SSDs, supported by older Apple peripherals. For leisure, I use Apple TV, Sony headphones, and Sonos speakers. For music, I play older Fender and Gibson guitars, a tube amplifier, and a digital effects pedal.
