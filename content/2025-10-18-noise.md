description: A few things worth noting.

The more plugins you have, the more distracted you become in your text editor, defeating the purpose of having it in the first place. Similarly, the more pedals you collect, the farther you drift from focusing on your playing. Ironically, the very tools meant to help you make music end up getting in the way of making it. The same applies to many pursuits in life: the more we add, the less we often create.

Then there’s the moment of insight, an idea that illuminates us. Instead of developing it deeply, we start searching for more, thinking that quantity will lead to quality. Somehow, we’d rather have ten ideas that might work than one that truly does. Again, the more we add, the less we focus on what actually works.
