Considering current times, the number of books and mass media, the situation is a lot worse today. Also, no country has fallen as Roman Empire did… So it’s a lot worse but global dynamics also evolved. Untruth existed for a long time and there’s nothing new about mind boggling nonsense that affected (negatively) the history of mankind. From @phillipsTruthBriefHistory2020 []

> It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction. - Harry G Frankfurt

> Truth had ever one father but lies a 1000 men’s bastards. - Montaigne

> We have reason to fear that multitude of books which grows everyday will make the following centuries fall into a state as barbarous as that of the centuries that followed the fall of Roman Empire. - Written in 1685 by French Scholar Adrien Baillet

> There’s an extremely limited number of ways of being right and an almost infinite number of ways to be wrong.
