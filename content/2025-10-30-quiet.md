description: A few things worth noting.

This morning, I experienced deep satisfaction in rediscovering the tastes, sounds, and sensations I can effortlessly perceive, which profoundly affect my mind. Many advocate practicing gratitude to achieve such effects, yet prescriptive approaches may diminish the impact of these effects. Instead, I believe in cultivating a mindful life through a personal practice, discovered and developed individually, rather than adhering to fashionable methods for a quiet and peaceful life.
