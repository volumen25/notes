Willpower, like a muscle, can tire. The only question is when.

Rules, like guidelines, help us navigate life. We’ve been taught to follow them since childhood. Think about speed limits, hallway running, and instructions. Rules are everywhere, but we haven’t used them to our advantage. They shape our behaviour and can help us achieve our goals.

Make good choices the default choice.

When you use willpower to make your future self’s choices, create an automatic rule.
