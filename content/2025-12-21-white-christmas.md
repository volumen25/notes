I started learning this song in December 2022, approaching it one phrase at a time and at a very gradual pace in the weeks leading up to Christmas. In retrospect, I might have chosen a particularly challenging arrangement, but after dedicating so much time and effort to it, I feel compelled to continue. The sunk cost fallacy has locked me into seeing it through to the end.
