description: A series of consecutive problems over an extended period is not sustainable.

Some problems come from life itself—they shape us, test us, make us stronger. Struggling with them gives the soul weight and meaning. But other problems are man-made—born of fear, control, and small minds. They do not lift us up; they drain us. In places ruled by politics and pretense, effort leads nowhere. Spirit fades. It is better to face real storms than to rot in still air. Better a hard truth than a quiet, comfortable lie.
