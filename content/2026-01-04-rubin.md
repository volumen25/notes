Rick Rubin is a remarkable man who has produced such notable artists as Johnny Cash and Jake Bugg. I recently came across The Way of Code [@anthropicRickRubinWay], in which he notes, "Each encounter I’ve had with Lao Tzu has pointed to something new. Almost as if the book changes with every reading. I first picked up Stephen Mitchell’s translation 40 years ago at the Bodhi Tree bookstore in Los Angeles, and my life has never been quite the same.” When I read the Tao Te Ching [@tzuTaoTeChing1989], I was equally taken away.
