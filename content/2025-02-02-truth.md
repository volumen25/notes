Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.

This rule presents a nuanced view of truthfulness, balancing moral integrity with practical wisdom.

1. Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is inconvenient. This emphasizes integrity and consistency. Actions should reflect truth, even when it is difficult or disadvantageous. Honesty in behavior builds trust and self-respect.
2. Never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth. Here, “fool” likely refers to someone who lacks wisdom, is incapable of understanding truth, or deliberately twists it. In such cases, speaking the truth can be harmful rather than enlightening. A fool may manipulate truth to serve their own misunderstanding or deception.

Underlying Principle:

- Truth should be upheld in one’s own actions and character.
- However, truth should be wisely shared, considering the capacity of the listener to understand and respect it.
- Sometimes, silence or discretion is more powerful than speaking the truth to those who will misuse it.

This aligns with ancient wisdom, like in Proverbs:

“Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him.” (Proverbs 26:4)
