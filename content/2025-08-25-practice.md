description: A few things worth noting.

I recorded my Week 8 performance, which proceeded smoothly. I have modified my approach by not recording every exercise, instead focusing on daily guitar practice and study. On Day 7, following a breathing session, I played continuously without stopping for mistakes, recording the full set in a single take. I treated it as a real performance, beginning with a breath and concluding with a smile. Today, I forgot to include "Amazing Grace" at the end. There were some mistakes, but they did not affect me. I particularly appreciated the sound of my instrument, on which I focused. My emphasis was on tone rather than speed, except for the last couple of bars of the shuffle in A, where I played slightly faster than the metronome.
