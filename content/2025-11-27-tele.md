The rosewood fingerboard and the U-shaped maple neck immediately caught my eye. I recognized this fine instrument instantly; it was the same Telecaster we had seen during our visit to Tokyo last year. And now, here I was, holding it in my hands, this time at the Fender Flagship Store in Harajuku. It felt and sounded incredible. What a thrilling yet confusing moment, torn between desire and indecision. In the end, we bought it and brought it home safely, thanks to the exceptional care and service of the ANA staff at Haneda Airport.
