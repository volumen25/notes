Rigid things have a tendency to break. For example, physical things like airplane wings or ships will flex and not break when in turbulence. Non-physical things such as rules, procedures, and protocols, unless flexible, will break when under pressure. 

Flexible things have a tendency to adapt. Thus, it's important to find a balance between rigidity and flexibility. Strong enough to withstand and weak enough to conform and all the while maintain physical and non-physical integrity. 

Perfectionism and idealism bring about rigidity; keep that in mind, always. The problem is that you are a perfectionist. The desire for perfection could be a deadly weakness; see @denkEveryGoodBoy2022.
