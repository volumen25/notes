When stuck on a problem or seeking advice, I turn to trusted sources of wisdom: ancient authors or people deeply influenced by past wisdom. • @musashiBookFiveRings2005• @tzuArtWar2005 • @tzuTaoTeChing1989 • @senecaShortnessLifeOther1997 • @aureliusMeditationsNewTranslation2003 • @suzukiZenMindBeginner2020 • @wattsMyOwnWay2007 • @murakamiNovelistVocation2022 • @penroseRoadRealityComplete2004 • @frankfurtBullshit2005 • @rovelliThereArePlaces2022 • @talebFooledRandomnessHidden2005 • @greeneLawsHumanNature2019 • @rutherfurdNewYorkNovel2010 • @machiavelliPrince1998• @polyaHowSolveIt2014 …

I keep my software setup simple. On my Mac, I rely on the built-in apps, and at work I use Notepad++ and Firefox. For writing and research, Obsidian, Pandoc, Quarto, Positron, and Zotero are essential, with KeePassXC and NetNewsWire handling security and news. Homebrew keeps things tidy, and Spotify and MuseScore cover the music side.   

I like durable, straightforward tools. For writing, I use Leuchtturm1917 and MD notebooks, a mix of pencils and fountain pens, and plenty of sticky notes. My daily devices include an iPad Air, a Mac Studio with matching display, an iPhone, and a couple of SSDs, supported by older but reliable Apple peripherals. For leisure, I lean on Apple TV, Sony headphones, and Sonos speakers.
