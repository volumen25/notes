Some memory lapses occur because we become self-conscious. Let go of self-consciousness and allow the energy of the music, and of the fear and excitement of performing, to flow freely through our body and mind. @bruserArtPracticingGuide1999 [p.216].

We have one lifetime in which to express ourselves and to connect to others. A performance in that sense a microcosm of life: We have one one chance, and we want to give it everything we have. @bruserArtPracticingGuide1999 [p.227].
