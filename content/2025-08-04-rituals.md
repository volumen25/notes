Ultimate satisfaction arises from performing small rituals, regardless of success or failure. Rather than fixating on large goals, Mogi [@mogiLittleBookIkigai2018] encourages us to focus on small, relatable tasks we can engage in daily. Practice for the sake of practice, following Suzukiâ€™s [@suzukiZenMindBeginner2020] teaching. Pause and reflect: what is truly wonderful is the act of practice itself. Then begin again and continue practicing. When you follow this simple rule, you may gain unexpected powers. Before you attain them, they seem extraordinary; afterward, they feel like nothing special. And that is the ultimate satisfaction.
