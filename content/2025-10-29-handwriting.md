description: A few things worth noting.
---

The act of using a good pen or pencil overrides the dissatisfaction one feels from bad-looking handwriting. I currently don't like how my handwriting looks; imprecise lettering, frequent errors, and sometimes crossing out words when I can't erase them make the written page look suboptimal. That said, with this pen and this notebook, I still enjoy transferring my thoughts onto paper. And when I look back on these written pages, they actually don't look that bad; they possess qualities beyond pristine, almost sanitized handwriting. I like to think it's similar to something handmade; perfection in imperfection, beauty lying in the meaning the written words carry, not only in what they display. Needless to say, beautifully legible handwriting is still something I strive for; however, the tension in my grip and the clutter in my mind often negatively influence it.
