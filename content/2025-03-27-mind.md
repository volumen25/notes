description: A few things worth noting.

When man is spared real struggle, he manufactures his own. Deprived of battle, he wages war against shadows, offended by whispers, unsettled by silence. The absence of hardship does not bring peace; it breeds restlessness.

Work suffers the same fate. Without a higher purpose, we busy ourselves with the trivial, polishing stones that need no shine. We mistake movement for progress, refinement for creation.

Man was not made for stillness. Even in calm waters, his spirit thrashes, yearning for a storm.
