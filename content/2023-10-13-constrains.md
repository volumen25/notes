The objective is to make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Albert Einstein is known to have said that). Self-imposed constraints facilitate the simplification of concepts and processes. However, the risk of oversimplification must be considered, as it may compromise the desired outcome. Thus, self-imposed constraints can be regarded as an art form, enabling the effective achievement of goals.

When a task involves numerous steps or requires substantial resources, its completion becomes increasingly challenging. Self-imposed constraints help minimize or eliminate distractions and foster creativity. Creativity, in turn, is the key to originality.
