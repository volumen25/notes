Reflect on what youâ€™ve read and written. Information becomes knowledge by reflection. Reflection cultivates intuition. Abundant intuition makes up for the lack of information, thereby enabling you to operate where your knowledge is limited.

This principle aligns with learning theory, cognitive science, and decision-making.

- Reflection strengthens understanding by consolidating knowledge through critical thinking.
- Intuition, developed through reflection and experience, recognizes patterns based on past experiences, as seen in expertise development.
- Reflection enables effective decision-making under uncertainty, as seen in fields like medicine, engineering, and chess, where seasoned practitioners rely on intuition.

In short, reflection turns raw data into actionable knowledge, making this principle sound and useful.
