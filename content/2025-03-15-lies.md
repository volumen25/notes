A Turkish proverb says, “A fool may throw a stone into a well that a hundred wise men cannot pull out.” Inspired by this, one observation is, “One lie cannot be undone by forty truths.” Both express that a single careless act can have severe consequences, even with effort and truth. They highlight the asymmetry between destruction and repair, deception and truth.

## Compare and Contrast

The first proverb suggests reckless actions can create problems even the wisest struggle to fix. The metaphor of the stone in the well emphasizes permanence and unintended consequences.

The second saying shifts the focus to honesty and deception. A single lie, once spoken, alters perception and trust, making it difficult to correct with numerous truths. Like the stone in the well, the damage lingers.

Both reflect human nature: words and actions, especially careless ones, can have a greater impact than we anticipate. Even wisdom and truth have limits in undoing past mistakes.

The wise are powerless against certain forms of foolishness. The assumption that knowledge and truth can always correct falsehoods is an illusion. Wisdom can only mitigate consequences, not erase them. True wisdom may lie in recognizing that some things, once done, can’t be undone. Ultimately, responsibility lies in preventing harm before it occurs. Once the stone is in the well or the lie is spoken, the damage is done.
