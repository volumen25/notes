description: A few things worth noting.
---

1. The mind, like nature, abhors a vacuum. Deprived of real suffering, it fabricates troubles of its own, magnifying the trivial until it becomes unbearable. 
2. The absence of hardship does not bring peace; it breeds restlessness. 
3. The most essential ingredient in any recipe is the appetite of those to whom the meal is served. 
4. The universe operates on principles that prevent total destruction, but these same principles also limit easy solutions to life’s problems.
5. Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.
