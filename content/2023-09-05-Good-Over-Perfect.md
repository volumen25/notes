## Radical Simplicity

- Scalability and interoperability take precedence over a multitude of nonessential features.
- Scalability derives from simplicity, speed, and ease of use. Interoperability stems from clear, unembellished content.
- Minimizing distractions enhances the quality of writing and the productivity of reading.
- New features must not complicate the simplest use case and should remain unobtrusive to users who do not require them.

## Iterate

Continuous improvement is more valuable than striving for perfection.
