I recall Nassim Taleb's advice to avoid reading newspapers. If one must engage with them, he suggests reading editions from a year prior, allowing you to assess the news with the benefit of hindsight and a clearer perspective.

News can shape our perceptions in distinct ways:

- Positive news: Uplifting stories, affirmations, and encouragement.
- Negative news: Drama, criticism, and controversy.

In our workplaces, communities, or neighborhoods, whether a high-rise building, a city block, or a small town, news circulates constantly, influencing our decisions. To maintain clarity, we must discern what is truly valuable from what is mere noise. Often, this means turning off the news or avoiding newspapers altogether.
