  {"id":"bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017","abstract":"The essence of this book can be found in a line written by the ancient Roman Stoic Philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca: \"Fortune is of sluggish growth, but ruin is rapid\". This sentence summarizes the features of the phenomenon that we call \"collapse,\" which is typically sudden and often unexpected, like the proverbial \"house of cards.\" But why are such collapses so common, and what generates them? Several books have been published on the subject, including the well known \"Collapse\" by Jared Diamond (2005), \"The collapse of complex societies\" by Joseph Tainter (1998) and \"The Tipping Point,\" by Malcom Gladwell (2000). Why The Seneca Effect? This book is an ambitious attempt to pull these various strands together by describing collapse from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint. The reader will discover how collapse is a collective phenomenon that occurs in what we call today \"complex systems,\" with a special emphasis on system dynamics and the concept of \"feedback.\" From this foundation, Bardi applies the theory to real-world systems, from the mechanics of fracture and the collapse of large structures to financial collapses, famines and population collapses, the fall of entire civilzations, and the most dreadful collapse we can imagine: that of the planetary ecosystem generated by overexploitation and climate change. The final objective of the book is to describe a conclusion that the ancient stoic philosophers had already discovered long ago, but that modern system science has rediscovered today. If you want to avoid collapse you need to embrace change, not fight it. Neither a book about doom and gloom nor a cornucopianist's dream, The Seneca Effect goes to the heart of the challenges that we are facing today, helping us to manage our future rather than be managed by it.","author":[{"family":"Bardi","given":"Ugo"}],"citation-key":"bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-57207-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"430","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Amazon","title":"The Seneca Effect: Why Growth is Slow but Collapse is Rapid","title-short":"The Seneca Effect","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bottonArchitectureHappiness2008","abstract":"Bestselling author Alain de Botton considers how our private homes and public edifices influence how we feel, and how we could build dwellings in which we would stand a better chance of happiness.In this witty, erudite look at how we shape, and are shaped by, our surroundings, Alain de Botton applies Stendhal’s motto that “Beauty is the promise of happiness” to the spaces we inhabit daily. Why should we pay attention to what architecture has to say to us? de Botton asks provocatively.With his trademark lucidity and humour, de Botton traces how human needs and desires have been served by styles of architecture, from stately Classical to minimalist Modern, arguing that the stylistic choices of a society can represent both its cherished ideals and the qualities it desperately lacks. On an individual level, de Botton has deep sympathy for our need to see our selves reflected in our surroundings; he demonstrates with great wisdom how buildings — just like friends — can serve as guardians of our identity. Worrying about the shape of our sofa or the colour of our walls might seem self-indulgent, but de Botton considers the hopes and fears we have for our homes at a new level of depth and insight. When shopping for furniture or remodelling the kitchen, we don’t just consider functionality but also the major questions of aesthetics and the philosophy of art: What is beauty? Can beautiful surroundings make us good? Can beauty bring happiness? The buildings we find beautiful, de Botton concludes, are those that represent our ideas of a meaningful life. The Architecture of Happiness marks a return to what Alain does best — taking on a subject whose allure is at once tantalizing and a little forbidding and offering to readers a completely beguiling and original exploration of the subject. As he did with Proust, philosophy, and travel, now he does with architecture.From the Hardcover edition.","author":[{"family":"Botton","given":"Alain De"}],"citation-key":"bottonArchitectureHappiness2008","ISBN":"978-0-7710-2607-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,8]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"McClelland & Stewart","source":"Amazon","title":"The Architecture of Happiness","type":"book"},

Life is difficult enough as a precocious, temperamental, and insufferable six-year-old piano prodigy in New Jersey. But then a family meltdown forces a move to New Mexico, far from classical music's nerve centers, and he has to please a new taskmaster while navigating cacti, and the perils of junior high school. Escaping from New Mexico at last, he meets a bewildering cast of college music teachers, ranging from boring to profound, and experiences a series of humiliations and triumphs, to find his way as one of the world's greatest living pianists, a MacArthur \"Genius, \" and a frequent performer at Carnegie Hall. There are few writers working today who are willing to eloquently explore both the joys and miseries of artistic practice. Hours of daily repetition, mystifying early advice, pressure from parents and teachers who drove him on--an ongoing battle of talent against two enemies: boredom and insecurity. As we meet various teachers, with cruel and kind streaks, Denk composes a fraught love letter to the act of teaching. He brings you behind the scenes, to look at what motivates both student and teacher, locked in a complicated and psychologically perilous relationship. In his imaginative prose, Denk explores how classical music is relevant to \"real life, \" despite its distance in time. He dives into pieces and composers that have shaped him--Bach, Mozart, Schubert, and Brahms, among others--and gives unusual lessons on melody, harmony, and rhythm. Why and how do these fundamental elements have such a visceral effect on us? He tries to sum up many of the lessons he has gotten, to repay the debt of all his amazing teachers; to remind us that music is our creation, and that we need to keep asking questions about its purpose\"--","author":[{"family":"Denk","given":"Jeremy"}],"call-number":"ML417.D38 A3 2022","citation-key":"denkEveryGoodBoy2022","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-8129-9598-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number-of-pages":"368","publisher":"Random House","publisher-place":"New York","source":"North Vancouver City Library","title":"Every Good Boy Does Fine: A Love Story in Music Lessons","title-short":"Every good boy does fine","type":"book"},

The sea has provided an effective barrier against invasion and enabled the culture to develop in unique ways. During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shoguns successfully closed the country to the West. Then, Japan swung in the opposite direction, adopting Western culture wholesale.

We live ina world full of people with extraordinary abilities. Consider what Roger Federer can do with a tennis ball, or Connor McDavid with a puck. There are chess grandmasters who can play several dozen different games simultaneously--while blindfolded--and a seemingly unending supply of young musical prodigies who would have astonished aficionados a century ago. We are dramatically better at just about everything than we were just a generation ago. We assume, though, that these peak performers are the lucky ones, the ones with a gift. That's only partly true.The fact is we are all lucky. We all have that gift. As Ericsson's whole career has shown, with the proper practice, we are all capable of extraordinary feats. On the surface, the techniques that chess players use to develop their skills seem quite different from the methodssoccer players use to perfect their games, which in turn seem quite different from how pianists improve their playing. But at a deeper level, they are all variations ona single fundamental approach to learning, what Ericsson, a world-renowned researcher, has named \"deliberate practice\": a simple, yet powerful system for enhancing learning. This approach to expertise has the potential to revolutionize how we think about every sort of education and training. We are not limited by an endowment of natural talent. We create our own limits. Whether you wantto step up your game at work or on the weekend, or help your kid achieve athletic or academic goals, Ericsson's revolutionary methods will show you how to master almost anything.\"--","author":[{"family":"Ericsson","given":"K.

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview. This unusual depth has helped make The Tim Ferriss Show the first business/interview podcast to pass 100 million downloads. “This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and ‘inside baseball’ you won’t find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met. “What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis? “I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter.

From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, their short profiles can help you answer life's most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.From the author: In 2017, several of my close friends died in rapid succession. It was a very hard year, as it was for many people. It was also a stark reminder that time is our scarcest, non-renewable resource. With a renewed sense of urgency, I began asking myself many questions: Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want? How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning? How could I be kinder to myself? How could I better say “no” to the trivial many to better say “yes” to the critical few? How could I best reassess my priorities and my purpose in this world? To find answers, I reached out to the most impressive world-class performers in the world, ranging from wunderkinds in their 20s to icons in their 70s and 80s. No stone was left unturned. This book contains their answers—practical and tactical advice from mentors who have found solutions. Whether you want to 10x your results, get unstuck, or reinvent yourself, someone else has traveled a similar path and taken notes. This book, Tribe of Mentors, includes many of the people I grew up viewing as idols or demi-gods. Less than 10% have been on my podcast (The Tim Ferriss Show, more than 200 million downloads), making this a brand-new playbook of playbooks. No matter your challenge or opportunity, something in these pages can help. Among other things, you will learn: • More than 50 morning routines—both for the early riser and those who struggle to get out of bed. • How TED curator Chris Anderson realized that the best way to get things done is to let go. • The best purchases of $100 or less (you'll never have to think about the right gift again). • How to overcome failure and bounce back towards success. • Why Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton believes that the best art will always be the riskiest. • How to meditate and be more mindful (and not just for those that find it easy). • Why tennis champion Maria Sharapova believe that “losing makes you think in ways victories can’t.” • How to truly achieve work-life balance (and why most people tell you it isn’t realistic). • How billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz transformed the way he engages with difficult situations to reduce suffering. • Ways to thrive (and survive) the overwhelming amount of information you process every day. • How to achieve clarity on your purpose and assess your priorities. • And much more. This reference book, which I wrote for myself, has already changed my life. I certainly hope the same for you. I wish you luck as you forge your own path.

  {"id":"frankfurtBullshit2005","abstract":"#1 New York Times bestsellerFeatured on The Daily Show and 60 MinutesThe acclaimed book that illuminates our world and its politics by revealing why bullshit is more dangerous than lyingOne of the most prominent features of our world is that there is so much bullshit. Yet we have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, how it’s distinct from lying, what functions it serves, and what it means. In his acclaimed bestseller On Bullshit, Harry Frankfurt, who was one of the world’s most influential moral philosophers, explores this important subject, which has become a central problem of politics and our world.With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the bullshitter’s capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that the truth matters. Because of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.Remarkably prescient and insightful, On Bullshit is a small book that explains a great deal about our time.","author":[{"family":"Frankfurt","given":"Harry G."}],"citation-key":"frankfurtBullshit2005","event-place":"Princeton, NJ","ISBN":"978-0-691-12294-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,30]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"80","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, NJ","source":"Amazon","title":"On Bullshit","type":"book"},
  {"id":"frankfurtTruth2006","abstract":"Having outlined a theory of bullshit and falsehood, Harry G. Frankfurt turns to what lies beyond them: the truth, a concept not as obvious as some might expect.Our culture's devotion to bullshit may seem much stronger than our apparently halfhearted attachment to truth. Some people (professional thinkers) won't even acknowledge \"true\" and \"false\" as meaningful categories, and even those who claim to love truth cause the rest of us to wonder whether they, too, aren't simply full of it. Practically speaking, many of us deploy the truth only when absolutely necessary, often finding alternatives to be more saleable, and yet somehow civilization seems to be muddling along. But where are we headed? Is our fast and easy way with the facts actually crippling us? Or is it \"all good\"? Really, what's the use of truth, anyway?With the same leavening wit and commonsense wisdom that animates his pathbreaking work On Bullshit, Frankfurt encourages us to take another look at the truth: there may be something there that is perhaps too plain to notice but for which we have a mostly unacknowledged yet deep-seated passion. His book will have sentient beings across America asking, \"The truth—why didn't I think of that?\"","author":[{"family":"Frankfurt","given":"Harry G."}],"citation-key":"frankfurtTruth2006","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-307-26422-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,31]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"112","publisher":"Knopf","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"On Truth","type":"book"},
  {"id":"franklManSearchMeaning2006","abstract":"Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (\"meaning\")-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, Man's Search for Meaning had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a \"book that made a difference in your life\" found Man's Search for Meaning among the ten most influential books in America.

  {"id":"goodmanGrowingAbsurdProblems2012","abstract":"Paul Goodman’s Growing Up Absurd was a runaway best seller when it was first published in 1960, and it became one of the defining texts of the New Left. Goodman was a writer and thinker who broke every mold and did it brilliantly—he was a novelist, poet, and a social theorist, among a host of other things—and the book’s surprise success established him as one of America’s most unusual and trenchant critics, combining vast learning, an astute mind, utopian sympathies, and a wonderfully hands-on way with words.For Goodman, the unhappiness of young people was a concentrated form of the unhappiness of American society as a whole, run by corporations that provide employment (if and when they do) but not the kind of meaningful work that engages body and soul. Goodman saw the young as the first casualties of a humanly re­pressive social and economic system and, as such, the front line of potential resistance. Noam Chomsky has said, “Paul Goodman’s impact is all about us,” and certainly it can be felt in the powerful localism of today’s renascent left. A classic of anarchist thought, Growing Up Absurd not only offers a penetrating indictment of the human costs of corporate capitalism but points the way forward.

  {"id":"harrisonGardensEssayHuman2009","abstract":"Humans have long turned to gardens—both real and imaginary—for sanctuary from the frenzy and tumult that surrounds them. Those gardens may be as far away from everyday reality as Gilgamesh’s garden of the gods or as near as our own backyard, but in their very conception and the marks they bear of human care and cultivation, gardens stand as restorative, nourishing, necessary havens.With Gardens, Robert Pogue Harrison graces readers with a thoughtful, wide-ranging examination of the many ways gardens evoke the human condition. Moving from from the gardens of ancient philosophers to the gardens of homeless people in contemporary New York, he shows how, again and again, the garden has served as a check against the destruction and losses of history. The ancients, explains Harrison, viewed gardens as both a model and a location for the laborious self-cultivation and self-improvement that are essential to serenity and enlightenment, an association that has continued throughout the ages. The Bible and Qur’an; Plato’s Academy and Epicurus’s Garden School; Zen rock and Islamic carpet gardens; Boccaccio, Rihaku, Capek, Cao Xueqin, Italo Calvino, Ariosto, Michel Tournier, and Hannah Arendt—all come into play as this work explores the ways in which the concept and reality of the garden has informed human thinking about mortality, order, and power.Alive with the echoes and arguments of Western thought, Gardens is a fitting continuation of the intellectual journeys of Harrison’s earlier classics, Forests and The Dominion of the Dead. Voltaire famously urged us to cultivate our gardens; with this compelling volume, Robert Pogue Harrison reminds us of the nature of that responsibility—and its enduring importance to humanity.\"I find myself completely besotted by a new book titled Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition, by Robert Pogue Harrison. The author . . . is one of the very best cultural critics at work today. He is a man of deep learning, immense generosity of spirit, passionate curiosity and manifold rhetorical gifts.\"—Julia Keller, Chicago Tribune\"This book is about gardens as a metaphor for the human condition. . . . Harrison draws freely and with brilliance from 5,000 years of Western literature and criticism, including works on philosophy and garden history. . . . He is a careful as well as an inspiring scholar.\"—Tom Turner, Times Higher Education\"When I was a student, my Cambridge supervisor said, in the Olympian tone characteristic of his kind, that the only living literary critics for whom he would sell his shirt were William Empson and G. Wilson Knight. Having spent the subsequent 30 years in the febrile world of academic Lit. Crit. . . . I’m not sure that I’d sell my shirt for any living critic. But if there had to be one, it would unquestionably be Robert Pogue Harrison, whose study Forests: The Shadow of Civilization, published in 1992, has the true quality of literature, not of criticism—it stays with you, like an amiable ghost, long after you read it.“Though more modest in scope, this new book is similarly destined to become a classic. It has two principal heroes: the ancient philosopher Epicurus . . . and the wonderfully witty Czech writer Karel Capek, apropos of whom it is remarked that, whereas most people believe gardening to be a subset of life, ‘gardeners, including Capek, understand that life is a subset of gardening.’”—Jonathan Bate, The Spectator","author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Robert Pogue"}],"citation-key":"harrisonGardensEssayHuman2009","edition":"Illustrated edition","event-place":"Chicago, Ill.","ISBN":"978-0-226-31790-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,15]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"264","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago, Ill.","source":"Amazon","title":"Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition","title-short":"Gardens","type":"book"},

  {"id":"johnsonKantsMoralPhilosophy2024","abstract":"Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that the supreme principle ofmorality is a principle of practical rationality that he dubbed the“Categorical Imperative” (CI). Kant characterized the CIas an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle thatwe must follow despite any natural desires we may have to thecontrary. All specific moral requirements, according to Kant, arejustified by this principle, which means that all immoral actions areirrational because they violate the CI. Other philosophers, such asHobbes, Locke and Aquinas, had also argued that moral requirements arebased on standards of rationality. However, these standards wereeither instrumental principles of rationality for satisfyingone’s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rational principlesthat are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas. Kant agreedwith many of his predecessors that an analysis of practical reasonreveals the requirement that rational agents must conform toinstrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformity to the CI(a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moral requirementsthemselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to rationalagency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that arational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the sense ofbeing the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental principleof morality — the CI — is none other than the law of anautonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant’s moral philosophyis a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs goes wellbeyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the passions. Moreover,it is the presence of this self-governing reason in each person thatKant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as possessed ofequal worth and deserving of equal respect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Cureton","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"johnsonKantsMoralPhilosophy2024","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Fall 2024","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."},{"family":"Nodelman","given":"Uri"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Kant’s Moral Philosophy","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2024/entries/kant-moral/"},

Our ability to prevent and reverse these conditions -- and feel incredible today -- is under our control and simpler than we think. The key is our metabolic function -- the most important and least understood factor in our overall health. As Dr. Casey Means explains in this groundbreaking book, nearly every health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells in our body create and use energy. To live free from frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our cells to be optimally powered so that they can create \"good energy, \" the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of our physical and mental wellbeing. If you are battling minor signals of \"bad energy\" inside your body, it is often a warning sign that more life-threatening illness may emerge later in life.

  {"id":"montaigneCompleteEssays1993","abstract":"Michel de Montaigne was one of the most influential figures of the Renaissance, singlehandedly responsible for popularising the essay as a literary form. This Penguin Classics edition of The Complete Essays is translated from the French and edited with an introduction and notes by M.A. Screech. In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals, poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience. But, above all, Montaigne studied himself as a way of drawing out his own inner nature and that of men and women in general. The Essays are among the most idiosyncratic and personal works in all literature and provide an engaging insight into a wise Renaissance mind, continuing to give pleasure and enlightenment to modern readers. With its extensive introduction and notes, M.A. Screech's edition of Montaigne is widely regarded as the most distinguished of recent times. Michel de Montaigne (1533-1586) studied law and spent a number of years working as a counsellor before devoting his life to reading, writing and reflection. If you enjoyed The Complete Essays, you might like Francois Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel, also available in Penguin Classics.

Tokitsu has spent most of his life researching the legendary samurai swordsman and his works, and in this book he illuminates this seminal text, along with several other works by Musashi. These include “The Mirror of the Way of Strategy,” which Musashi wrote when he was in his twenties; “Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy,” and “Forty-two Instructions on Strategy,” which were precursors to The Book of Five Rings; and “The Way to Be Followed Alone,” which Musashi wrote just days before his death. Read together, these five texts give readers an unusually detailed, nuanced view of Musashi’s ideas on swordsmanship, strategy, and self-cultivation. Tokitsu puts all these writings into historical and philosophical context and makes them accessible and relevant to today’s readers and martial arts students.

  {"id":"nietzscheTwilightIdolsFriedrich2018","abstract":"Twilight of the Idols by Friedrich Nietzsche. Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer is a book by Friedrich Nietzsche, written in 1888, and published in 1889. Twilight of the Idols was written in just over a week, between 26 August and 3 September 1888, while Nietzsche was on holiday in Sils Maria. About life, the wisest men of all ages have come to the same conclusion: it is no good. Always and everywhere one has heard the same sound from their mouths — a sound full of doubt, full of melancholy, full of weariness of life, full of resistance to life. Even Socrates said, as he died: \"To live — that means to be sick a long time: I owe Asclepius the Savior a rooster.\" Even Socrates was tired of life. What does that prove? What does it demonstrate? At one time, one would have said (and it has been said loud enough by our pessimists): \"At least something must be true here! The consensus of the sages must show us the truth.\" Shall we still talk like that today? May we? \"At least something must be sick here,\" we retort. These wisest men of all ages — they should first be scrutinized closely. Were they all perhaps shaky on their legs? tottery? decadent? late? Could it be that wisdom appears on earth as a raven, attracted by a little whiff of carrion?","author":[{"family":"Nietzsche","given":"Friedrich"}],"citation-key":"nietzscheTwilightIdolsFriedrich2018","ISBN":"978-1-7188-0075-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,7]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"90","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","source":"Amazon","title":"Twilight of the Idols: Friedrich Nietzsche","title-short":"Twilight of the Idols","translator":[{"family":"Kaufmann","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Hollingdale","given":"R.

  {"id":"nietzscheWillPower2017","abstract":"New to Penguin Classics, The Will to Power contains some of Nietzsche's most fascinating and combative writings on nihilism, metaphysics and the future of Europe.   Assembled by Nietzsche’s sister after his death, The Will to Power is a collection of the philosopher’s reflections and theories taken from his unpublished notebooks. Covering topics such as nihilism, Christianity, morality, and the famous “will to power,” the book was controversially presented as Nietzsche’s all-but-completed magnum opus containing his philosophical system. Including some of his most interesting metaphysical and epistemological thoughts, as well as some of his most disturbing ethical and political comments, the book would prove to have a significant influence on Nietzsche’s contentious reception in the twentieth century.   For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

  {"id":"picardieCocoChanelLegend2011","abstract":"Filled with fresh new research and never-before-seen photos, this updated edition of the definitive biography of Coco Chanel deepens our understanding of the history and legacy of the incredible woman who shaped modern fashion and created an empire of haute couture.Coco Chanel was an extraordinary inventor, conjuring up the little black dress, bobbed hair, trousers for women, contemporary chic, bestselling perfumes, and the most successful fashion brand of all time. But she also invented herself, fashioning the myth of her own life with the same dexterity as her couture; and what lies beneath her own glossy surface is darker, more mysterious, and far more intriguing.Uncovering remarkable new details about Gabrielle Chanel’s humble early years, Justine Picardie picks up the legend Chanel where it began—in orphanhood and poverty. Throwing new light on her passionate and, at times, dark relationships and providing profound insights into her connections with Cocteau, Diaghilev, Picasso, and Dali, this beautifully constructed portrait gives a fresh and penetrating look at what made Coco Chanel the strong-spirited and powerful presence she became. An authoritative account, based on personal observations and interviews with Chanel’s last surviving friends, employees, and relatives, the book also unravels her coded language and symbols and tracks the influence of her formative years on her legendary style.Feared and revered by the rest of the fashion industry, Coco Chanel died in 1971 at the age of 87, but her legacy lives on. This special new edition has been extensively revised and updated and offers a uniquely authoritative account of the world’s greatest designer. Adding fresh new insights and discoveries, it comes complete with a compelling array of previously unseen images from the Chanel archives.","author":[{"family":"Picardie","given":"Justine"}],"citation-key":"picardieCocoChanelLegend2011","edition":"Illustrated edition","ISBN":"978-0-06-207417-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,23]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"352","publisher":"It Books","source":"Amazon","title":"Coco Chanel: The Legend and the Life","title-short":"Coco Chanel","type":"book"},

  {"id":"rogersDiffusionInnovations5th2003","abstract":"Now in its fifth edition, Diffusion of Innovations is a classic work on the spread of new ideas.In this renowned book, Everett M. Rogers, professor and chair of the Department of Communication & Journalism at the University of New Mexico, explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.","author":[{"family":"Rogers","given":"Everett M."}],"citation-key":"rogersDiffusionInnovations5th2003","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-7432-2209-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"576","publisher":"Free Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition","type":"book"},

This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.” —Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat “Cooking shouldn’t just be about making a delicious dish—owning the process and enjoying the experience ought to be just as important as the meal itself. The new Joy of Cooking is a reminder that nothing can compare to gathering around the table for a home cooked meal with the people who matter most.” —Joanna Gaines, author of Magnolia Table In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma’s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott.John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today’s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research, and improve Joy’s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques, and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread—all retested and faithfully improved—as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan’s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder. In addition to a thoroughly modernized vegetable chapter, there are many more vegan and vegetarian recipes, including Caramelized Tamarind Tempeh, Crispy Pan-Fried Tofu, Spicy Chickpea Soup, and Roasted Mushroom Burgers. Joy’s baking chapters now include gram weights for accuracy, along with a refreshed lineup of baked goods like Cannelés de Bordeaux, Rustic No-Knead Sourdough, Ciabatta, Chocolate-Walnut Babka, and Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza, as well as gluten-free recipes for pizza dough and yeast breads. A new chapter on streamlined cooking explains how to economize time, money, and ingredients and avoid waste. You will learn how to use a diverse array of ingredients, from amaranth to za’atar. New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation, and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking, and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail. This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes, and indispensable reference information for today’s home cooks. Whether it is the only cookbook on your shelf or one of many, Joy is and has been the essential and trusted guide for home cooks for almost a century.

  {"id":"sapolskyDeterminedScienceLife2023","abstract":"The instant New York Times bestseller“Excellent . . . Outstanding for its breadth of research, the liveliness of the writing, and the depth of humanity it conveys.” –Wall Street JournalOne of our great behavioral scientists, the bestselling author of Behave, mounts a devastating scientific and philosophical case against free will—an argument with profound consequencesRobert Sapolsky’s Behave, his now classic account of why humans do good and why they do bad, pointed toward an unsettling conclusion: we may not grasp exactly how nature and nurture create the physics and chemistry that cause all human behavior, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. In Determined, Sapolsky takes his argument all the way, mounting a brilliant (and in his inimitable way, delightful) full-frontal assault on the pleasant fantasy that there is some separate self who tells our biology what to do.Determined offers a marvelous synthesis of what we know about consciousness—the tight weave between reason and emotion and between stimulus and response in the moment and over a life. One by one, Sapolsky takes out all the major arguments for free will, cutting a path through the thickets of chaos theory and quantum physics. But as Sapolsky acknowledges, it’s sometimes impossible to uncouple from our zeal to judge people, including ourselves. Determined applies this new understanding to some of our most essential questions around punishment, morality, and living well together. Most of all, Sapolsky argues that while accepting the reality about free will is monumentally difficult, it will make for a much more humane world.","author":[{"family":"Sapolsky","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"sapolskyDeterminedScienceLife2023","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-525-56097-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"528","publisher":"Penguin Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will","title-short":"Determined","type":"book"},

  {"id":"senecaLettersStoic1969","abstract":"\"It is philosophy that has the duty of protecting us...without it no one can lead a life free of fear or worry.\"For several years of his turbulent life, Seneca was the guiding hand of the Roman Empire. His inspired reasoning derived mainly from the Stoic principles, which had originally been developed some centuries earlier in Athens. This selection of Seneca's letters shows him upholding the austere ethical ideals of Stoicism—the wisdom of the self-possessed person immune to overmastering emotions and life’s setbacks—while valuing friendship and the courage of ordinary men, and criticizing the harsh treatment  of slaves and the cruelties in the gladiatorial arena. The humanity and wit revealed in Seneca’s interpretation of Stoicism is a moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

  {"id":"smithChingBiography2012","abstract":"How the I Ching became one of the most widely read and influential books in the worldThe I Ching originated in China as a divination manual more than three thousand years ago. In 136 BCE the emperor declared it a Confucian classic, and in the centuries that followed, this work had a profound influence on the philosophy, religion, art, literature, politics, science, technology, and medicine of various cultures throughout East Asia. Jesuit missionaries brought knowledge of the I Ching to Europe in the seventeenth century, and the American counterculture embraced it in the 1960s. Here Richard Smith tells the extraordinary story of how this cryptic and once obscure book became one of the most widely read and extensively analyzed texts in all of world literature.In this concise history, Smith traces the evolution of the I Ching in China and throughout the world, explaining its complex structure, its manifold uses in different cultures, and its enduring appeal. He shows how the indigenous beliefs and customs of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Tibet \"domesticated\" the text, and he reflects on whether this Chinese classic can be compared to religious books such as the Bible or the Qur'an. Smith also looks at how the I Ching came to be published in dozens of languages, providing insight and inspiration to millions worldwide―including ardent admirers in the West such as Leibniz, Carl Jung, Philip K. Dick, Allen Ginsberg, Hermann Hesse, Bob Dylan, Jorge Luis Borges, and I. M. Pei. Smith offers an unparalleled biography of the most revered book in China's entire cultural tradition, and he shows us how this enigmatic ancient classic has become a truly global phenomenon.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Richard J."}],"citation-key":"smithChingBiography2012","edition":"First Edition","event-place":"Princeton, N.J","ISBN":"978-0-691-14509-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,25]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, N.J","source":"Amazon","title":"The I Ching: A Biography","title-short":"The I Ching","type":"book"},

Dr. Suzuki has dedicated his life to the subject of Zen, and to interpreting its philosophy and concepts for the Western reader. Of his more than a dozen works currently available in English, An Introduction to Zen Buddhism is most suitable as the basic text for the general reader interested in understanding Zen.After situating Zen both in Buddhism and in Oriental culture, Suzuki then answers the fundamental question \"What is Zen?\" in an incisive, lucid chapter that also refutes several misconceptions common in the West. Continually drawing on his extraordinary knowledge of both Eastern and Western cultures, philosophies, and religions, he illustrates each concept of Zen with concrete examples abounding in wit and wisdom. Zen is not only a philosophy-a way to self¬understanding-it is also \"primarily and ultimately a discipline,\" and Dr. Suzuki gives due attention to the practical aspects of this discipline.

Zen Buddhism, which sold more than 125,000 as an Anchor paperback after its publication in 1956, includes a basic historical background as well as a thorough overview of the techniques for Zen practice. Concepts and terminology such as satori, zazen, and koans, as well as the various elements of this philosophy are all given clear explanations. But while Suzuki takes nothing for granted in the reader's understanding of the fundamentals, he does not give a merely rudimentary overview. Each of the essays included here, particularly those on the unconscious mind and the relation of Zen to Western philosophy, go far beyond other sources for their penetrating insights and timeless wisdom.What is most important about D.T. Suzuki's work, however--and what comes across so powerfully in these selections--is his unparalleled ability to communicate the experiential aspect of Zen. The intensity here with which Zen philosophy comes to life is without parallel in the canon of Buddhist literature. Suzuki stands apart from all teachers before or since because of his exceptional ability to eloquently capture in words the seemingly inexpressible essence of Zen.","author":[{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Daisetz T."},{"family":"Barrett","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"suzukiZenBuddhismSelected1996","edition":"Reissue edition","ISBN":"978-0-385-48349-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",7,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"400","publisher":"Harmony","source":"Amazon","title":"Zen Buddhism: Selected Writings of D.T.

  {"id":"wattsMyOwnWay2007","abstract":"In this new edition of his acclaimed autobiography  long out of print and rare until now  Alan Watts tracks his spiritual and philosophical evolution from a child of religious conservatives in rural England to a freewheeling spiritual teacher who challenged Westerners to defy convention and think for themselves. From early in this intellectual life, Watts shows himself to be a philosophical renegade and wide-ranging autodidact who came to Buddhism through the teachings of Christmas Humphreys and D. T. Suzuki. Told in a nonlinear style,In My Own Way wonderfully combines Watts’ own brand of unconventional philosophy and often hilarious accounts of gurus, celebrities, psychedelic drug experiences, and wry observations of Western culture. A charming foreword written by Watts’ father sets the tone of this warm, funny, and beautifully written story of a compelling figure who encouraged readers to follow your own weird”  something he always did himself, as his remarkable account of his life shows.","author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"wattsMyOwnWay2007","event-place":"Novato, Calif","ISBN":"978-1-57731-584-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5,12]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"384","publisher":"New World Library","publisher-place":"Novato, Calif","source":"Amazon","title":"In My Own Way: An Autobiography","title-short":"In My Own Way","type":"book"},
