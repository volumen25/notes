<title>Seneca Effect</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#seneca-effect</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#seneca-effect</guid>
<description>The Seneca Effect [@bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017], as explained by Ugo Bardi, views complex systems through a systems-thinking lens. Drawing on Seneca’s observation that ”increases are of sluggish growth, but the way to ruin is rapid,” the book suggests that systems grow gradually but collapse swiftly d...</description>

<title>Imperfection</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#imperfection</guid>
<description>I once came across this thought, though I can’t recall where: regrets belong to the past, and anxieties to the future. One cannot be at peace with life without truly living it. The past is fixed, the future uncertain and often overwhelming. The mind wrestles with both, but the solution is simple: ac...</description>

<description>When I seek guidance, I turn to books. Classical philosophy and strategy teach leadership and discipline, especially during workplace challenges [@musashiBookFiveRings2005; @tzuArtWar2005; @tzuTaoTeChing1989; @machiavelliPrince1998]. The Stoics highlight life’s fragility [@senecaShortnessLifeOther19...</description>

<description>Quiet your mind to hear the nuances in the notes. Slowing down and calming the mind unveils hidden harmonies, textures, and rhythms. While this is a learning exercise, it also yields a delightful surprise in the resultant sounds....</description>

<title>Durability</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#durability</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#durability</guid>
<description>When it comes to tools, I prefer those that strike a balance between durability and simplicity. Durable tools endure wear and tear, ensuring their longevity and maximizing the value of investment. Simplicity in design and usage makes tasks easier and more efficient. I value tools that are both durab...</description>

<title>Practice as Performance</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#practice-as-performance</guid>
<description>I recorded my Week 8 performance, which proceeded smoothly. I have modified my approach by not recording every exercise, instead focusing on daily guitar practice and study. On Day 7, following a breathing session, I played continuously without stopping for mistakes, recording the full set in a sing...</description>

<title>One and Done</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#one-and-done</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#one-and-done</guid>
<description>I find myself increasingly drawn to a “one-and-done” philosophy when it comes to worldly possessions. There’s a quiet realization that I don’t have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the things I have, like pens, guitars, and other tools. It seems that to understand something deeply...</description>

<title>Asymmetries</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#asymmetries</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#asymmetries</guid>
<description>I noticed certain asymmetries that govern the relationship between positive and negative outcomes—for example effort versus gain; especially once a critical point has been passed, such as the point of diminishing returns.  The Pareto distribution provides another example of this kind of asymmetry (r...</description>

<description>Darwin [@darwinAutobiographyCharlesDarwin2003] documented any information that contradicted his evolving theories and conclusions. He recognized confirmation bias long before it had a name and developed a practical system to counteract it. I try to do the same when reading or listening to podcasts. ...</description>

<description>Practice with discipline, but without friction, maintaining a calm and steady approach. Take each step deliberately to enter the flow state where progress unfolds. Though progress is not the goal, it arises as a consequence of unintended outcomes. This is the ultimate state of mind, the one that bri...</description>

<description>When we travel, there is almost no downtime as we hop from one place to another. Exploration is wonderful. Seeing extraordinary places, nature, and culture often leaves us in overwhelming awe, yet these moments tend to slip away with time, leaving only fragments in our long-term memory. What is almo...</description>

<description>Daniel Kahneman said most people make quick judgments and then try to prove themselves right. The wisest wait, gather facts, and trust their intuition last.  I recently learned that Kahneman passed away on March 27, 2024, though his death wasn’t announced until March 2025. He was best known for his ...</description>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#reflection-cultivates-intuition</guid>
<description>Reflect on what you’ve read and written. Information becomes knowledge by reflection. Reflection cultivates intuition. Abundant intuition makes up for the lack of information, thereby enabling you to operate where your knowledge is limited.  This principle aligns with learning theory, cognitive scie...</description>

<title>Experiments vs. Exercises</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#experiments-vs-exercises</guid>
<description>Thought experiments are mental exercises that explore scenarios and analyze concepts without physical action. They are commonly used in philosophy, science, and ethics to challenge assumptions and clarify ideas. For example, Maxwell’s Demon: A hypothetical demon that seemingly violates thermodynamic...</description>

<title>80 Percent Limit</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#80-percent-limit</guid>
<description>Learn to stop at 80% mark in eating, talking, and working to stay sharp, leave space for others, and keep your energy for what matters. The idea of stopping at 80% comes from the Japanese concept hara hachi bu, which means eating until you’re about 80% full. This idea can also be applied to other ar...</description>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#the-power-of-small-rituals</guid>
<description>Ultimate satisfaction arises from performing small rituals, regardless of success or failure. Rather than fixating on large goals, Mogi [@mogiLittleBookIkigai2018] encourages us to focus on small, relatable tasks we can engage in daily. Practice for the sake of practice, following Suzuki’s [@suzukiZ...</description>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#premature-optimization</guid>
<description>As Donald Knuth wrote in 1974, programmers often waste effort optimizing too early; “premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming” [@knuthStructuredProgrammingGo1974]. This sentiment applies beyond code. We often fall into the trap of optimization too early,...</description>

<title>Tools</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#tools</guid>
<description>We build tools to create objects, ideas, and dreams. These tools and their creations slip quietly into our souls, remaking us into strangers to our former selves. As they can do good or harm, we must carefully design them. This can be a vicious cycle; thus, we must strive for a virtuous one....</description>

<description>Borges wrote and lectured extensively on the art of translation, holding that a translation may improve upon the original, may even be unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid....</description>

<title>On Problem-solving</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#on-problem-solving</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#on-problem-solving</guid>
<description>Some problems come from life itself—they shape us, test us, make us stronger. Struggling with them gives the soul weight and meaning. But other problems are man-made—born of fear, control, and small minds. They do not lift us up; they drain us. In places ruled by politics and pretense, effort leads ...</description>
