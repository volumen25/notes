    <h1>Volūmen</h1>
<p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I mainly use notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “scroll” referring to a rolled
manuscript. In ancient Rome, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was the
standard format for written texts before the codex, or bound book,
became common.</p>

<p>I am currently focused solely on transitioning from my current job to
my new one. While it is not a huge task, it is taking a lot of mental
energy. If I had had less time before the transfer, it would have been
much easier, being a completionist making it more difficult than it
should be.</p>
<p>I have been listening to Julian Lage’s latest album, “Scenes From
Above”. What a wonderful musical experience to witness it as it happens,
unlike much of the music I enjoy, which was recorded before I was born.
To top it off, we discovered that Lage is bringing his quartet to the
UBC Chan Centre in October 2026. We quickly secured two seats.</p>
<p>As for guitar practice, I am playing Okinawa Skies Revisited. The
fingerstyle playing helps develop intimacy with the instrument, and this
song is nearly perfect for this practice. The bridge pickup is bright
and will not hide any mistakes in how you approach fingerpicking. Once
you have mastered the piece, playing it on the neck pickup results in a
creamy smooth and warm tone.</p>

<p>2026-01-25</p>
<p>Julian Lage quietly released a new album, Scenes From Above, on
January 23, 2026. The music is wonderful, and it’s especially special
because it features another talented musician, the keyboardist John
Medeski. We also get to enjoy his long-term bandmates, the bassist Jorge
Roeder and the drummer Kenny Wollesen.</p>

<p>2026-01-11</p>
<p>Man makes tools. In turn, tools make a different man through his
work. Neither the man nor the tool remains the same; they are forever
transformed, locked in a reciprocal process of mutual becoming, thereby
perpetually evolving.</p>
<p>Likewise, a man takes up a job. Before too long, the job begins to
change him, sometimes in directions unwanted, unnoticed until the shift
is already taking hold. One day he arrives at the fork in the road,
where that familiar ultimatum echoes at the break of dawn: my way
<em>or</em> the highway.</p>
<p>But life is not binary! What if we invert it to find a third option:
my way <em>and</em> the highway, that is to say: my highway.</p>

<p>During one summer, I had the opportunity to review my guitar
practices that I recorded since 2018 and a few earlier than that. I
named the playlist <em>Ever So Slowly</em>, because it’s been such a
slow process for me to make progress on the guitar. That said, the
playlist also demonstrates the fact that slow learning can take one to
far places. The motto remains the same: no hurry, no pause. And this
year, the focus is on triads.</p>

<p>The rosewood fingerboard and the U-shaped maple neck immediately

same Telecaster we had seen during our visit to Tokyo last year. And
now, here I was, holding it in my hands, this time at the Fender
Flagship Store in Harajuku. It felt and sounded incredible. What a
thrilling yet confusing moment, torn between desire and indecision. In
the end, we bought it and brought it home safely, thanks to the
exceptional care and service of the ANA staff at Haneda Airport.</p>

<h1 id="on-handwriting">On Handwriting</h1>
<p>2025-10-29</p>
<p>The act of using a good pen or pencil overrides the dissatisfaction
one feels from bad-looking handwriting. I currently don’t like how my
handwriting looks; imprecise lettering, frequent errors, and sometimes
crossing out words when I can’t erase them make the written page look
suboptimal. That said, with this pen and this notebook, I still enjoy
transferring my thoughts onto paper. And when I look back on these
written pages, they actually don’t look that bad; they possess qualities
beyond pristine, almost sanitized handwriting. I like to think it’s
similar to something handmade; perfection in imperfection, beauty lying
in the meaning the written words carry, not only in what they display.
Needless to say, beautifully legible handwriting is still something I
strive for; however, the tension in my grip and the clutter in my mind
often negatively influence it.</p>

<h1 id="the-plateau-of-talent">The Plateau of Talent</h1>
<p>2025-10-21</p>
<p>From Haruki Murakami’s novel Kafka on the Shore, <span
class="citation" data-cites="murakamiKafkaShore2006">(Murakami,
2006)</span> translated into English by Philip Gabriel. The passage
appears in a section where the character Oshima is speaking to Kafka
Tamura about talent, discipline, and what Murakami calls “the plateau of
talent.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They can’t take it any further. And why not? Because they won’t put
in the effort. Because they haven’t had the discipline pounded into
them. They’ve been spoiled. They have just enough talent so they’ve been
able to play things well without any effort and they’ve had people
telling them how great they are from the time they’re little, so hard
work looks stupid to them. They’ll take some piece another kid has to
work on for three weeks and polish it off in half the time, so the
teacher figures they’ve put enough into it and lets them go to the next
thing. And they do that in half the time and go on to the next piece.
They never find out what it means to be hammered by the teacher; they
lose out on a certain element required for character building. It’s a
tragedy.</p>

<p>The more plugins you have, the more distracted you become in your
text editor, defeating the purpose of having it in the first place.
Similarly, the more pedals you collect, the farther you drift from
focusing on your playing. Ironically, the very tools meant to help you
make music end up getting in the way of making it. The same applies to
many pursuits in life: the more we add, the less we often create.</p>
<p>Then there’s the moment of insight, an idea that illuminates us.
Instead of developing it deeply, we start searching for more, thinking
that quantity will lead to quality. Somehow, we’d rather have ten ideas
that might work than one that truly does. Again, the more we add, the
less we focus on what actually works.</p>

<p>I prefer durable, straightforward hardware. For writing, I use
Leuchtturm1917 and MD notebooks, mechanical pencils, simple fountain
pens, and sticky notes. My daily devices include an iPhone, an iPad Air,
a Mac Studio, and two SSDs, supported by older peripherals. For leisure,
I use Apple TV, Sony headphones, and Sonos speakers. For music, I play
older Fender and Gibson guitars, a tube amplifier, and a digital effects
unit.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I like to keep my tools simple. At home, I use macOS’s built-in apps
and Homebrew to manage software. Bash and Python handle automation. For
writing and research, I move through Obsidian, Pandoc, Positron, Quarto,
and Zotero. KeePassXC and NetNewsWire keep things secure and connected,
while Spotify and MuseScore take care of the music. By contrast, work
feels more like a uniform: the standard Microsoft suite, with a little
freedom in Notepad++ for notes and Firefox for the Internet.</p>

<p>The Seneca Effect <span class="citation"
data-cites="bardiSenecaEffectWhy2017">(Bardi, 2017)</span>, as explained
by Ugo Bardi, views complex systems through a systems-thinking lens.
Drawing on Seneca’s observation that ”increases are of sluggish growth,
but the way to ruin is rapid,” the book suggests that systems grow
gradually but collapse swiftly due to fragilities, critical thresholds,
and negative feedback loops.</p>
<p>In contrast, Everett Rogers’ ”Diffusion of Innovations” <span
class="citation" data-cites="rogersDiffusionInnovations5th2003">(Rogers,
2003)</span> explains how innovations spread through social systems,
from innovators to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and
laggards. Network effects, where a product’s value increases with its
user base, accelerate adoption.</p>
<p>The Seneca curve, with slow growth and rapid collapse, contrasts with
the viral adoption curve, or ”Hype curve”, which exhibits rapid growth
followed by a slower decline. Rogers’ model, driven by social contagion
and positive feedback, leads to swift adoption, but enthusiasm may wane
as market saturation or limitations emerge.</p>
<p>From a system dynamics perspective, the Seneca Effect is fuelled by
negative feedback loops that amplify vulnerabilities, causing rapid
collapse. Conversely, the Hype curve is propelled by positive feedback
loops, such as network effects and social influence, accelerating
adoption but potentially diminishing over time, leading to a gradual
decline.</p>

<p>I recorded my Week 8 performance, which proceeded smoothly. I have
modified my approach by not recording every exercise, instead focusing
on daily guitar practice and study. On Day 7, following a breathing
session, I played continuously without stopping for mistakes, recording
the full set in a single take. I treated it as a real performance,
beginning with a breath and concluding with a smile. Today, I forgot to
include “Amazing Grace” at the end. There were some mistakes, but they
did not affect me. I particularly appreciated the sound of my

<h1 id="one-and-done">One and Done</h1>
<p>2025-08-25</p>
<p>I find myself increasingly drawn to a “one-and-done” philosophy when
it comes to worldly possessions. There’s a quiet realization that I
don’t have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the
things I have, like pens, guitars, and other tools. It seems that to
understand something deeply, to let it reveal its full functionality
over time, one must live with it for years. Multiplicity divides
attention; depth asks for commitment.</p>

<h1 id="asymmetries">Asymmetries</h1>
<p>2025-08-25</p>
<p>I noticed certain asymmetries that govern the relationship between
positive and negative outcomes—for example effort versus gain;
especially once a critical point has been passed, such as the point of
diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The Pareto distribution provides another example of this kind of
asymmetry (roughly 80% of outcomes stem from 20% of causes).</p>
<p>This phenomenon is also discussed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb,
particularly in relation to “long tails.” He frequently emphasizes
asymmetry and fat-tailed distributions in the context of risk,
probability, and decision-making, especially in his books <em>The Black
Swan</em> and <em>Antifragile</em>. <span class="citation"

documented any information that contradicted his evolving theories and

when reading or listening to podcasts. Here’s an idea that goes against
the grain:</p>
<p>Chinese economist Keyu Jin discusses the Chinese motto “quick, flat,
fast.” While it’s considered a short-term trend, short-termism
prioritizes immediate profit or reward, quick execution of projects, and
short-term results over long-term results and strategic action.</p>

<p>When we travel, there is almost no downtime as we hop from one place

nature, and culture often leaves us in overwhelming awe, yet these
moments tend to slip away with time, leaving only fragments in our
long-term memory. What is almost permanently stored in the mind,
however, are some ordinary parts of experiences and the sensations they
evoked: a quiet street with rundown houses, yet somehow charming, or a
walk on flat terrain by the rice paddies, bringing truly remarkable
emotions despite seemingly unremarkable perceptions for most people. I
find this hard to grasp and somewhat bizarre, but I must accept it.

<p>Reflect on what you’ve read and written. Information becomes
knowledge by reflection. Reflection cultivates intuition. Abundant
intuition makes up for the lack of information, thereby enabling you to
operate where your knowledge is limited.</p>
<p>This principle aligns with learning theory, cognitive science, and
decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection strengthens understanding by consolidating knowledge
through critical thinking.</li>
<li>Intuition, developed through reflection and experience, recognizes
patterns based on past experiences, as seen in expertise
development.</li>
<li>Reflection enables effective decision-making under uncertainty, as
seen in fields like medicine, engineering, and chess, where seasoned
practitioners rely on intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, reflection turns raw data into actionable knowledge, making
this principle sound and useful.</p>

<h1 id="premature-optimization">Premature Optimization</h1>
<p>2025-08-03</p>
<p>As Donald Knuth wrote in 1974, programmers often waste effort
optimizing too early; “premature optimization is the root of all evil
(or at least most of it) in programming” <span class="citation"
data-cites="knuthStructuredProgrammingGo1974">(Knuth, 1974)</span>. This
sentiment applies beyond code. We often fall into the trap of
optimization too early, whether in programming, designing a template, or
starting an exercise routine. Instead of putting a functional version to
use, we start tweaking it, reshaping it until we barely recognize it. As
a result, we lose the value of the original. The code ends up doing
things we do not need, the template produces excessive output, and the
workout becomes so complicated that it discourages us from following
through.</p>
<p>It is often better to stick with the raw idea, no matter how rough or
unrefined it may be. If you follow it long enough, perhaps for a year or
even a month, you may start to notice natural patterns emerge. Haruki
Murakami describes a similar experience in <em>Novelist as a
Vocation</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="murakamiNovelistVocation2022">(Murakami, 2022)</span>. Early
in his career, feeling constrained by traditional Japanese prose, he
began writing in English and then translating the text back into
Japanese. The process was not optimal, but it helped him discover a
personal voice. Rather than optimizing the method, he committed to it,
letting clarity and style emerge over time through repeated
practice.</p>

<h1 id="sustain-or-cycle">Sustain or cycle</h1>
<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>The longer you remain seated and focus on a task, the shallower you
breathe, and the less oxygen gets to your brain. Therefore, quickly step
away from your work and cycle your attention every 20 minutes. Quickly
stepping away from your work to get a drink of water, walk around the
block, or go to the bathroom to splash water on your face allows you to
consciously regulate your breathing and get more oxygen to your brain
(so you can extend your focus session).</p>
<p>During your mini work breaks perform “box breathing” like Navy Seals
do before combat:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a deep four second inhale,</li>
<li>hold for four seconds,</li>
<li>exhale for four seconds,</li>
<li>hold for another four seconds</li>
<li>repeat for the entire work break.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you move during your mini work break, you can replenish the
neurochemicals you need to focus. Dr. Andrew Huberman says, “Physical
movement activates pathways in the brain that increase dopamine, which
is the basis for epinephrine (aka, adrenaline) and all neural energy.”
In other words, a short movement period can provide the fuel to focus
intensely and continue producing at a high level.</p>

<p>2025-04-22</p>
<p>To begin, you require only a book, a pen, and time. While additional
tools may appear beneficial, they can be counterproductive, resulting in
negative utility. These tools do not accelerate your work; rather, they
consume as much time as you are willing to expend on them.</p>
<p>The essence of productivity lies in performing the work itself. This
is the only productivity advice you need and the most valuable guidance
you will receive.</p>
<p>You could divert your attention to numerous optimizations, such as
managing email, scheduling meetings, organizing notes, maintaining
calendars, tracking time, setting goals, creating to-do lists,
estimating time requirements, applying prioritization frameworks, using
quantified self-sensors, analyzing data, adopting apps, managing
documents, or journaling.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to resist the temptation to become mired in
these optimizations. Instead, prioritize executing the work. When you
focus on the work, all other aspects will naturally optimize
themselves.</p>

<h1 id="rules-of-the-game">Rules of the Game</h1>
<p>2023-10-31</p>
<p>It is more feasible to play and potentially win a game of chess when
competing against an opponent who is also adhering to the rules of
chess. It is inconceivable to assume otherwise, as an opponent playing a
different game would fundamentally undermine the contest. Nevertheless,
it is entirely possible for individuals to engage in games without
adhering to established rules. A prudent individual must pause and
consider whether both parties are indeed playing the same game.</p>
<p>People frequently disregard or bend rules and conventions. Therefore,
one should never assume that an opponent is fully aware of the rules or
will adhere to the intended structure of the game.</p>
<p>Competent chess players often find it challenging to compete against
complete novices, as they are frequently surprised by the unconventional
moves novices make.</p>
<p>This principle extends beyond chess to any rule-based interaction,
where mutual understanding of conventions is critical.</p>

<h1 id="on-rigidity">On Rigidity</h1>
<p>2023-10-20</p>
<p>Rigid things have a tendency to break. For example, physical things
like airplane wings or ships will flex and not break when in turbulence.
Non-physical things such as rules, procedures, and protocols, unless
flexible, will break when under pressure.</p>
<p>Flexible things have a tendency to adapt. Thus, it’s important to
find a balance between rigidity and flexibility. Strong enough to
withstand and weak enough to conform and all the while maintain physical
and non-physical integrity.</p>
<p>Perfectionism and idealism bring about rigidity; keep that in mind,
always. The problem is that you are a perfectionist. The desire for
perfection could be a deadly weakness; see <span class="citation"

<p>2023-07-21</p>
<p>I recall Nassim Taleb’s advice to avoid reading newspapers. If one
must engage with them, he suggests reading editions from a year prior,
allowing you to assess the news with the benefit of hindsight and a
clearer perspective.</p>
<p>News can shape our perceptions in distinct ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive news: Uplifting stories, affirmations, and
encouragement.</li>
<li>Negative news: Drama, criticism, and controversy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our workplaces, communities, or neighborhoods, whether a high-rise
building, a city block, or a small town, news circulates constantly,
influencing our decisions. To maintain clarity, we must discern what is
truly valuable from what is mere noise. Often, this means turning off
the news or avoiding newspapers altogether.</p>
