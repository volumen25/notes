<title>Scenes From Above</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#scenes-from-above</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#scenes-from-above</guid>
<description>Julian Lage quietly released a new album, Scenes From Above, on
January 23, 2026. The music is wonderful, and it’s especially special
because it features another talented musician, the keyboardist John
Medeski. We also get to enjoy his long-term bandmates, the bassist Jorge
Roeder and the...</description>

<description>Man makes tools. In turn, tools make a different man through his
work. Neither the man nor the tool remains the same; they are forever
transformed, locked in a reciprocal process of mutual becoming, thereby
perpetually evolving.</description>

<title>Ever So Slowly</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#ever-so-slowly</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#ever-so-slowly</guid>
<description>During one summer, I had the opportunity to review my guitar
practices that I recorded since 2018 and a few earlier than that. I
named the playlist Ever So Slowly, because it’s been such a
slow process for me to make progress on the guitar. That said, the
playlist also demonstrates the fact that...</description>

<title>Rick Rubin</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#rick-rubin</guid>
<description>Rick Rubin is a remarkable man who has produced such notable artists
as Johnny Cash and Jake Bugg. I recently came across The Way of Code (Anthropic,
n.d.), in which he notes, “Each encounter I’ve had with Lao Tzu
has pointed to something new. Almost as if the book changes with every
reading. I...</description>

<description>Another year is about to conclude. It passed like we inhaled a breath
of fresh air yesterday, and today we are exhaling it, a little tired but
filled with hope and excitement. Looking back, the year has been,
despite its tiring parts, also full of joyful periods, growth, and
satisfaction.</description>

<title>Emptiness</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#emptiness</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#emptiness</guid>
<description>Clay transforms into pottery through craft, but it’s the emptiness
within that makes a pot truly useful. What’s absent can be just as
significant as what’s present. This idea originates from the Tao Te
Ching, a foundational text of Taoism. (Tzu &amp; Needleman, 1989)</description>

<title>White Christmas</title>

<description>I started learning this song in December 2022, approaching it one
phrase at a time and at a very gradual pace in the weeks leading up to
Christmas. In retrospect, I might have chosen a particularly challenging
arrangement, but after dedicating so much time and effort to it, I feel
compelled to...</description>

<description>The rosewood fingerboard and the U-shaped maple neck immediately
caught my eye. I recognized this fine instrument instantly; it was the
same Telecaster we had seen during our visit to Tokyo last year. And
now, here I was, holding it in my hands, this time at the Fender
Flagship Store in...</description>

<title>Quiet Mornings</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#quiet-mornings</guid>
<description>This morning, I experienced deep satisfaction in rediscovering the
tastes, sounds, and sensations I can effortlessly perceive, which
profoundly affect my mind. Many advocate practicing gratitude to achieve
such effects, yet prescriptive approaches may diminish the impact of
these effects....</description>

<title>On Handwriting</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#on-handwriting</guid>
<description>The act of using a good pen or pencil overrides the dissatisfaction
one feels from bad-looking handwriting. I currently don’t like how my
handwriting looks; imprecise lettering, frequent errors, and sometimes
crossing out words when I can’t erase them make the written page look
suboptimal. That...</description>

<title>The Plateau of Talent</title>
<link>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#the-plateau-of-talent</link>
<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#the-plateau-of-talent</guid>
<description>From Haruki Murakami’s novel Kafka on the Shore, (Murakami,
2006) translated into English by Philip Gabriel. The passage
appears in a section where the character Oshima is speaking to Kafka
Tamura about talent, discipline, and what Murakami calls “the plateau of
talent.”</description>

<description>The more plugins you have, the more distracted you become in your
text editor, defeating the purpose of having it in the first place.
Similarly, the more pedals you collect, the farther you drift from
focusing on your playing. Ironically, the very tools meant to help you
make music end up...</description>

<title>Uses</title>

<guid>https://notes.volumen.ca/index.html#uses</guid>
<description>When I seek guidance, I turn to books. Classical philosophy and
strategy teach leadership and discipline, especially during workplace
challenges (Machiavelli,
1998; Musashi, 2005; L. Tzu &amp; Needleman, 1989; S. Tzu, 2005).
The Stoics highlight life’s fragility (Aurelius,
2003; Seneca, 1997)....</description>

<description>The greatest worry about the idea of fake news isn’t actually that
people believe false news - it’s that they stop believing real news. Phillips (2020)</description>

<description>I came across this interesting thought on the internet: Consistent
daily writing yields a book in a year, while sporadic efforts result in
scattered fragments. The impact is profound. The initial effort feels
heavy, the first page slow, and the first video awkward, but each effort
lays...</description>

<description>Corb Lund, a Canadian country and western singer-songwriter from
Taber, Alberta, performed a great rendition of Bob Dylan’s ‘I Shall Be
Released’ on Tuff Radio this morning. He’s released twelve albums, with
three certified gold. Lund tours regularly in Canada, the US, and
Australia, winning...</description>

<description>The Seneca Effect (Bardi, 2017), as explained
by Ugo Bardi, views complex systems through a systems-thinking lens.
Drawing on Seneca’s observation that ”increases are of sluggish growth,
but the way to ruin is rapid,” the book suggests that systems grow
gradually but collapse swiftly due to...</description>

<description>I once came across this thought, though I can’t recall where: regrets
belong to the past, and anxieties to the future. One cannot be at peace
with life without truly living it. The past is fixed, the future
uncertain and often overwhelming. The mind wrestles with both, but the
solution is...</description>

<description>Quiet your mind to hear the nuances in the notes. Slowing down and
calming the mind unveils hidden harmonies, textures, and rhythms. While
this is a learning exercise, it also yields a delightful surprise in the
resultant sounds.</description>
